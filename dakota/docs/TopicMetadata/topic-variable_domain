Dakota variables can be grouped by their valid domains. 
-# Mixed: continuous and discrete variables are treated separately
-# Relaxed: noncategorical discrete variables are relaxed and treated as continuous variables (categorical variables are non-relaxable and remain discrete)

Refer to \ref variables-mixed and \ref variables-relaxed for additional information.

Blurb::
Selection of a random number generator

Description::
The \c rng keyword is used to indicate a choice of random number generator.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

If specified, the \c rng keyword must be accompanied by either \c
rnum2 (pseudo-random numbers) or \c mt19937 (random numbers generated
by the Mersenne twister).  Otherwise, \c mt19937, the Mersenne twister
is used by default.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

The default is recommended, as the Mersenne twister is a higher
quality random number generator.

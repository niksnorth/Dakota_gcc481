Specify the number of analysis servers when Dakota is run in parallel
Description::
The optional \c analysis_servers specification supports user override
of the automatic parallel configuration for the number of analysis
servers. That is, if the automatic configuration is
undesirable for some reason, the user can enforce a desired number of
partitions at the analysis parallelism level. Refer to ParallelLibrary 
and the Parallel Computing chapter of the Users Manual 
\cite UsersMan for additional information.

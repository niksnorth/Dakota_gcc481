Disable self-adaptive mutation
Description::
The SCOLIB EA method uses self-adaptive mutation, which modifies the mutation 
scale dynamically. This mechanism is borrowed from EAs like evolution 
strategies. The \c non_adaptive flag can be used to deactivate the 
self-adaptation, which may facilitate a more global search.

Note that \c non_adaptive is not recognized by Dakota as a valid keyword 
unless \c mutation_type has been specified.

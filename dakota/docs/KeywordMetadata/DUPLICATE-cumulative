Computes statistics according to cumulative functions

Description::
Statistics on model responses will be computed according to a
cumulative distribution/belief/plausibility function.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

By default, a cumulative distribution/belief/plausibility function
will be used.  To explicitly specify it in the Dakota input file,
however, the \c cumulative keyword must be appear in conjunction with
the \c distribution keyword.

<b> Expected Outputs </b>

Output will be a set of model response-probability pairs determined
according to a cumulative distribution/belief/plausibility function.
The probabilities reported are the probabilities that the model
response falls below given response threshholds.

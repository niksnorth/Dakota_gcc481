Computes statistics according to complementary cumulative functions

Description::
Statistics on model responses will be computed according to a
complementary cumulative distribution/belief/plausibility function.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

By default, a complementary cumulative
distribution/belief/plausibility function will not be used.  To change
that behavior, the \c complementary keyword must be appear in
conjunction with the \c distribution keyword.

<b> Expected Outputs </b>

Output will be a set of model response-probability pairs determined
according to a complementary cumulative
distribution/belief/plausibility function.  The probabilities reported
are the probabilities that the model response falls above given
response threshholds.

Reuses the same seed value for multiple random sampling sets

Description::
The \c fixed_seed flag is relevant if multiple sampling sets will be
generated over the coarse of a Dakota analysis. This occurs when using
advance methods (e.g., surrogate-based optimization, optimization
under uncertainty).  The same seed value is reused for each of these
multiple sampling sets, which can be important for reducing
variability in the sampling results.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

The default behavior is to not use a fixed seed, as the repetition of
the same sampling pattern can result in a modeling weakness that an
optimizer could potentially exploit (resulting in actual reliabilities
that are lower than the estimated reliabilities).  For repeatable
studies, the \c seed must also be specified.

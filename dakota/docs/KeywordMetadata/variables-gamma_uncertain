Aleatory uncertain variable - gamma
Description::
The gamma distribution is sometimes used to model time to complete a task, such as a repair or service task. It is a very flexible distribution with its shape governed by alpha and beta.

The density function for the gamma distribution is given by: 
\f[f(x) = \frac{{x}^{\alpha-1}{e}^{\frac{-x}{\beta}}}{\beta^{\alpha}\Gamma(\alpha)}\f]
where 
\f$\mu_{GA} = \alpha\beta\f$ and \f$\sigma^2_{GA} = \alpha\beta^2\f$. 
Note that the exponential distribution is a special
case of this distribution for parameter \f$\alpha = 1\f$.

Theory::
When used with design of experiments and multidimensional parameter
studies, distribution bounds are inferred.
These bounds are [0, \f$\mu + 3 \sigma\f$].

For vector and centered parameter studies, an inferred initial
starting point is needed for the uncertain variables.
These variables are initialized to their means for these studies.

Enables hierarchical evaluation tagging
Description::
The hierarchical tagging option is useful for studies involving
multiple models with a nested or hierarchical relationship.  For
example a nested model has a sub-method, which itself likely operates
on a sub-model, or a hierarchical approximation involves coordination
of low and high fidelity models.  Specifying \c hierarchical_tagging
will yield function evaluation identifiers ("tags") composed of the
evaluation IDs of the models involved, e.g.,
outermodel.innermodel.interfaceid = 4.9.2.  This communicates the
outer contexts to the analysis driver when performing a function
evaluation.

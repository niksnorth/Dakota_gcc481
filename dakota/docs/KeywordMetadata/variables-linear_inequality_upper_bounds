Define upper bounds for the linear inequality constraint
Description::
In the inequality case, the
lower \f$a_l\f$ and upper \f$a_u\f$ bounds provide constraint limits for the
two-sided formulation:
\f[a_l \leq Ax \leq a_u\f]

Where \f$A\f$ is the constrain matrix of variable coefficients.

As with nonlinear inequality constraints (see \ref responses-objective_functions), the 
default linear inequality constraint bounds are selected so that 
one-sided inequalities of the form
\f[Ax \leq 0.0\f]
result when there are no user bounds specifications (this provides
backwards compatibility with previous %Dakota versions).

In a user
bounds specification, any upper bound values greater than \c
+bigRealBoundSize (1.e+30, as defined in Minimizer) are treated as
+infinity and any lower bound values less than \c -bigRealBoundSize
are treated as -infinity. 

This feature is commonly used to drop one
of the bounds in order to specify a 1-sided constraint (just as the
default lower bounds drop out since \c -DBL_MAX < \c
-bigRealBoundSize).

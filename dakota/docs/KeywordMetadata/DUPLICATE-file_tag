Blurb::
Tag each parameters & results file name with the function evaluation
number

Description::
If this keyword is used, Dakota will append a period and the function evaluation
number to the names of the parameter and results files.

<b>Default Behavior</b>
If this keyword is omitted, the default is no file tagging. 

<b>Usage Tips</b>
- File tagging is most useful when multiple function evaluations are
  running simultaneously using files in a shared disk space. The
  analysis driver will be able to infer the function evaluation number
  from the file names.

- Note that when the \c file_save keyword is used, %Dakota
  automatically renames parameters and results files, giving them tags
  after execution of the analysis driver if they otherwise would be
  overwritten by the next evaluation.

Topics::

Examples::
If the following is included in the \c interface section of the Dakota
input:

\verbatim
  parameters_file = params.in
  results_file = results.out
  file_tag
\endverbatim

Then for the 3rd evaluation, Dakota will write \c params.in.3, and will expect 
\c results.out.3 to be written by the analysis driver.

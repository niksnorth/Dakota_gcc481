Blurb::
Percentage of evaluations to do to escape local minima.

Description::
The \c variable_neighborhood_search keyword is used to set the
percentage (in decimal form) of function evaluations used to escape
local minima.  The mesh adaptive direct search method will try to
perform a maximum of that percentage of the function evaluations
within this more extensive search.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

By default, \c variable_neighborhood_search is not used.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

Using \c variable_neighborhood_search results in an increased number
of function evaluations.  If the desired result is a local minimum,
the added cost is of little or no value, so the recommendation is not
to use it.  If the desired result is the best local minimum possible
within a computational budget, then there is value in setting this
parameter.  Note that the higher the value, the greater the
computational cost.  The value should be no greater than 1.0.

Examples::

The following example shows the syntax used to set \c
variable_neighborhood_search.

\verbatim
method
  mesh_adaptive_search
    seed = 1234
    variable_neighborhood_search = 0.1                      
\endverbatim

This describes the behavior of reuse of points in constructing polynomial 
chaos expansion models. 
Description::
The \c reuse_points option controls the reuse behavior of points for various types of polynomial chaos expansions, including: \c collocation_points, 
\c collocation_ratio, \c expansion_samples, or \c orthogonal_least_interpolation.  If any of these approaches are specified to create a set of points 
for the polynomial chaos expansion, one can specify \c reuse_points so that any points that have been previously generated (for example, from the \c import_points file) can be reused.

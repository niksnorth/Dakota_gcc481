Interval analysis using global optimization methods
Description::
In the global approach to interval estimation, one uses either a global optimization
method or a sampling method to assess the bounds of the responses.

\c global_interval_est
allows the user to specify several approaches to calculate 
interval bounds on the output responses. 
\li \c lhs - note: this takes the minimum and maximum of the samples as the bounds 
\li \c ego
\li \c sbo
\li \c ea

Blurb::
A surrogate model pointer that guides a method to whether it should use a surrogate model or compute truth function evaluations 

Description::
Dakota methods use global surrogate models to compute surrogate function approximations. They also need to know the true function evaluations. A global surrogate model now must have an actual_model_pointer keyword to decide for the method whether to evaluate the global surrogate model, or compute the true function evaluations if actual_model_pointer = ‘TRUTH’.

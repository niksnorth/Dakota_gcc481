Blurb::
Multipoint correction for a hierarchical surrogate

Description::
For the combined correction, the use of both additive and
multiplicative corrections allows the satisfaction of an additional
matching condition, typically the truth function values at the
previous correction point (e.g., the center of the previous trust
region). The combined correction is then a multipoint correction, as
opposed to the local additive and multiplicative corrections.

Select the type of Lipschitz estimation (global or local) 
Description::
There are two types of Lipschitz estimation used in sizing the disks used in 
POF Darts:  \c global and \c local.  The global approach uses 
one Lipschitz estimate for the entire domain.  The local approach calculates
the Lipschitz estimate separately for each Voronoi region based on nearby points.  
The local method is more expensive but more accurate.

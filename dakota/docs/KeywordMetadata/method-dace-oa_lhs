Orthogonal Array Latin Hypercube Sampling
Description::
The Orthogonal Array Latin Hypercube Sampling option in DACE 
produces a "latinized" version of an orthogonal array. 
That is, after the orthgonal array is generated, the samples 
go through a stratification process to produce samples that 
have been both orthogonalized and stratified.

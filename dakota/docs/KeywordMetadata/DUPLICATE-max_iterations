Number of iterations allowed for optimizers and adaptive UQ methods

Description::
The maximum number of iterations is used as a stopping criterion for
optimizers and some adaptive UQ methods.  If it has not reached any
other stopping criteria first, the method will stop after it has
performed \c max_iterations iterations.  See also \c
max_function_evaluations.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

Default value is 100.

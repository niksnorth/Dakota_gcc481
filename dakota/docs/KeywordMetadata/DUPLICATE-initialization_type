Specify how to initialize the population
Description::
The \c initialization_type defines how the initial population is created
for the GA. There are three types: 
-# \c simple_random  
-# \c unique_random (default)
-# \c flat_file

Setting the size for the \c flat_file initializer has the effect of
requiring a minimum number of designs to create. If this minimum
number has not been created once the files are all read, the rest are
created using the \c unique_random initializer and then the \c
simple_random initializer if necessary.

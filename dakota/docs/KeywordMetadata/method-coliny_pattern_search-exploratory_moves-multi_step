Examine trial step around successful new point
Description::
The \c multi_step case examines each trial step in the pattern in
turn.  If a successful step is found, the pattern search continues
examining trial steps about this new point.  In this manner, the
effects of multiple successful steps are cumulative within a single
iteration.  This option does not support any parallelism and will
result in a serial pattern

Adapt emulator model to increase accuracy in high posterior
probability regions

Description:: 
Following an emulator-based MCMC process, this option refines the
emulator by selecting points in regions of high posterior probability,
performing truth evaluations at these points, updating the emulator,
and reperforming the MCMC process.  The adaptation is continued until
the maximum number of iterations is exceeded or the convergence
tolerance is met.

Uses Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) to sample variables

Description::
The \c lhs keyword invokes Latin Hypercube Sampling as the means of
drawing samples of uncertain variables according to their probability
distributions.  This is a stratified, space-filling approach that
selects variable values from a set of equi-probable bins.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

Latin Hypercube Sampling is the default sampling mode in most contexts
(exception: multilevel_sampling).  To explicitly specify LHS in the
Dakota input file, the \c lhs keyword must appear in conjunction with
the \c sample_type keyword.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

Latin Hypercube Sampling is very robust and can be applied to any
problem.  It is fairly effective at estimating the mean of model
responses and linear correlations with a reasonably small number of
samples relative to the number of variables.

Blurb::
Specify which variables block will be included with this model block
Description::
The \c variables_pointer is used to specify which variables block will be used
by the model, by cross-referencing with \ref variables-id_variables keyword in
the \ref variables block.

See \ref topic-block_pointer for details about pointers.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

When a variables pointer is not specified, the model will use the last
variables block parsed from the input file.

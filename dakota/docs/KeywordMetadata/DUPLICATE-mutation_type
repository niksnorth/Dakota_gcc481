Select a mutation type for JEGA methods
Description::
Five mutation types are available for selection by keyword: 
\c replace_uniform, \c bit_random, \c offset_cauchy, \c offset_normal, and 
\c offset_uniform. They are described in greater detail on their 
respective keyword pages.

The \c offset_* mutators all act by adding a random "offset" to a variable 
value. The random amount has a mean of zero in all cases. The size of the offset 
is controlled using the \c mutation_scale keyword, which is interpreted 
differently for each \c offset_* type.

The rate of mutations for all types is controlled suing the \c mutation_rate.
The rate is applied differently in each \c mutation_type.

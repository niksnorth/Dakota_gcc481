Use a minimal simplex for the search pattern
Description::
If \c pattern_basis is \c simplex, then pattern search uses a minimal
positive basis simplex for the parameter space, for a total of \e n+1
function evaluations in the pattern.  Note that the \c simplex pattern
basis can be used for unbounded problems only.  The \c
total_pattern_size specification can be used to augment the basic \c
coordinate and \c simplex patterns with additional function
evaluations, and is particularly useful for parallel load balancing.
For example, if some function evaluations in the pattern are dropped
due to duplication or bound constraint interaction, then the \c
total_pattern_size specification instructs the algorithm to generate
new offsets to bring the total number of evaluations up to this
consistent total.

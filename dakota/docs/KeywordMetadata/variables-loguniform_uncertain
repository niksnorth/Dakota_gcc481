Aleatory uncertain variable - loguniform
Description::
If the logarithm of an uncertain variable X has a uniform distribution, that is 
\f$\log X \sim U(L_{LU},U_{LU})\f$, 
then X is distributed with a loguniform distribution. The distribution lower bound is \f$L_{LU}\f$ and upper bound is \f$L_{LU}\f$
The loguniform distribution has the density function:
\f[f(x) = \frac{1}{x(ln U_{LU} - ln {L_{LU}})}\f]

Theory::
For vector and centered parameter studies, an inferred initial
starting point is needed for the uncertain variables.
These variables are initialized to their means for these studies.

Specify the number of intervals for each variable
Description::
In %Dakota, epistemic uncertainty analysis is performed using either interval estimation or Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. 
In these approaches, one does not assign a probability distribution to each uncertain input variable.
Rather, one divides each uncertain input variable into one or more
intervals. The input parameters are only known to occur within
intervals; nothing more is assumed. \c num_intervals specifies the
number of such intervals associated with each interval uncertain parameter.

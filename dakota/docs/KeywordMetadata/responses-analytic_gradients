Analysis driver will return gradients

Description::
The \c analytic_gradients specification means that gradient
information is available directly from the simulation (finite
differencing is not required). The simulation must return the gradient
data in the %Dakota format (enclosed in single brackets; see %Dakota
File Data Formats in the Users Manual \cite UsersMan) 
for the case of file transfer of data. The \c analytic_gradients keyword 
is a complete specification for this case.

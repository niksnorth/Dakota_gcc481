Whether to minimize or maximize each objective function

Description::
The \c sense keyword is used to declare whether each objective function
should be minimized or maximized.  The argument options are:
\li \c "minimization" (can be abbreviated to "min")
\li \c "maximization" (can be abbreviated to "max")

The number of strings should either be equal to the number of
objective functions, or one.  If a single string is specified it will
apply to each objective function.

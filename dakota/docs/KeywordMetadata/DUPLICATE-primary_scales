Supply a characteristic value to scale each reponse

Description::

Each entry in \c primary_scales is a user-specified nonzero
characteristic value to scale each response.  The argument may be of
length 1 or the number of primary response functions.  If only one
scale is specified, it will apply to each primary response function.

See the scaling information under specific methods, e.g.,
method-*-scaling for details on how to use this keyword.

If scaling is specified, it is applied before multi-objective weighted
sums are formed.

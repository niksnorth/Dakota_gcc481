Blurb::  Number of scalar calibration terms
Description::
This keyword describes the number of scalar calibration terms. 
It is meant to be used in conjunction with \c field_calibration_terms, which describes
the number of field calibration terms.  The total number of calibration
terms, both scalar and field, is given by \c calibration_terms.  
If only scalar calibration terms are specified, it is not necessary 
to specify the number of scalar terms explicitly:  one can simply 
say \c calibration_terms = 5 and get 5 scalar terms. 
However, if there are three scalar terms and 2 field terms, then 
\c calibration_terms = 5 but \c scalar_calibration_terms = 3 and \c field_calibration_terms = 2. 

Calibration terms are responses that are used with calibration 
methods in Dakota, such as least squares optimizers.  Currently, each scalar term is added 
to the total sum-of-squares error function presented to the optimizer. However, 
each individual field value is added as well.   For example, 
if you have one field calibration term with length 100 (e.g. a time - temperature trace 
with 100 time points and 100 temperature points), the 100 temperature values 
will be added to create the overall sum-of-squares error function used in 
calibration.

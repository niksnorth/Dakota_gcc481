Adaptively rescale search directions
Description::
The \c adaptive_pattern case invokes a pattern search technique that
adaptively rescales the different search directions to maximize the
number of redundant function evaluations.  See \cite Hart2001c
for details of this method.  In preliminary
experiments, this method had more robust performance than the standard
\c basic_pattern case in serial tests.  This option supports a limited
degree of parallelism.  After successful iterations (where the step
length is not contracted), a parallel search will be performed.  After
unsuccessful iterations (where the step length is contracted), only a
single evaluation is performed.

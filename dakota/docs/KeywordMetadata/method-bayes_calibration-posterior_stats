Compute information-theoretic metrics on posterior parameter distribution

Description::
Information theory allows for the calculation and quantification of the 
information contained within a distribution. It is particularly useful for
distributions which are not Gaussian, such as those which are bimodal or highly 
skewed. The \c posterior_stats command calculates information metrics relating 
to the posterior distribution of the model parameters. These metrics are 
approximated by making use of the MCMC chain produced during the Bayesian 
update. This capability can be used with any Bayesian method.

Set niching distance to percentage of non-dominated range
Description::
The \c radial nicher requires as input a vector of fractions with
length equal to the number of objectives.  The elements of the vector
are interpreted as percentages of the non-dominated range for each
objective defining a minimum distance to all other designs.  All
values should be in the range (0, 1).  The minimum allowable distance
between any two designs in the performance space is the Euclidian
(simple square-root-sum-of-squares calculation) distance defined by
these percentages.  The \c distance nicher has a similar input vector
requirement, only the distance is the minimum distance in each
dimension.

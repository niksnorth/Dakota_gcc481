Hessians are needed and are available directly from the analysis driver

Description::
The \c analytic_hessians specification means that Hessian information
is available directly from the simulation. The simulation must return
the Hessian data in the %Dakota format (enclosed in double brackets;
see %Dakota File Data Formats in Users Manual \cite UsersMan) for the
case of file transfer of data. The \c analytic_hessians keyword is a
complete specification for this case.

Turn on regression diagnostics
Description::
When \c regression_diagnostics (NL2SOL's \c rdreq) is specified and a
positive-definite final Hessian approximation H is computed, NL2SOL
computes and prints a regression diagnostic vector RD such that if
omitting the i-th observation would cause alpha times the change in
the solution that omitting the j-th observation would cause, then
RD[i] = |alpha| RD[j]. The finite-difference step-size tolerance
affecting H is \ref responses-numerical_hessians-fd_step_size (NL2SOL's \c delta0 and \c
dltfdc).

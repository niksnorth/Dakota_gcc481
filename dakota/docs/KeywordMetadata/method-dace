Design and Analysis of Computer Experiments
Description::
The Distributed Design and Analysis of Computer Experiments (DDACE)
library provides the following DACE techniques: 
 -# grid sampling (\c grid)
 -# pure random sampling (\c random)
 -# orthogonal array sampling (\c oas)
 -# latin hypercube sampling (\c lhs)
 -# orthogonal array latin hypercube sampling (\c oa_lhs)
 -# Box-Behnken (\c box_behnken)
 -# central composite design (\c central_composite)

These methods all generate point sets that may be used to drive a set of 
computer experiments.  Note that all of the DACE methods generated 
randomized designs, except for Box-Behnken and Central composite which 
are classical designs.  That is, the grid sampling will generate a 
randomized grid, not what one typically thinks of as a grid 
of uniformly spaced points over a rectangular grid.  Similar, 
the orthogonal array is a randomized version of an orthogonal 
array:  it does not generate discrete, fixed levels. 

In addition to the selection of the method, there are keywords
that affect the method outputs: 
 -# \ref method-dace-main_effects
 -# \ref method-dace-quality_metrics
 -# \ref method-dace-variance_based_decomp

And keywords that affect the sampling:
 -# \ref method-dace-fixed_seed
 -# \ref method-dace-symbols
 -# \ref method-dace-samples
 -# \ref method-dace-seed

Blurb:: 
Enable exporting output sample sequences on files

Description:: 
If present, separate output files are written for each model form and discretization level.
For the multilevel technique, separate files are written for the samples used at each
iteration (pilot samples are denoted by iteration 0).

<b> Default Behavior </b>

If not specified, the \c annotated format is assumed.

<b> Expected Output </b>

Separate output files are generated according to the following format: 
\c {ml/cv}_{interface_id}_{iteration_number}_{level_number}_{number_of_samples}.dat.

If one single model form is present the first field of the file name is 
\c ml_, otherwise \c ml_ is used for the HF model and \c cv_ is used for the LF one.

Examples::
The following method block 
\verbatim
method,
	model_pointer = 'HIERARCH'
        multilevel_sampling
	  pilot_samples = 20 seed = 1237
	  convergence_tolerance = .01
	  output silent
	  export_sample_sequence
\endverbatim

results in enabling the sample output on file with the defaults \c annotated format.

The following variables block 
\verbatim
variables,
	id_variables = 'LF_VARS'
	uniform_uncertain = 7
	  lower_bounds    = 7*-1.
	  upper_bounds    = 7* 1.
	discrete_state_set
	  integer = 2
	    num_set_values = 4 1
	    set_values = 5 15 30 60 # number of spatial coords
	    	       	 3 	    # number of Fourier solution modes
	    initial_state = 5 3
	    descriptors 'N_x' 'N_mod'
\endverbatim

illustrates how to define descriptors for a model form. For instance, in this case the descriptors 
\c N_x and \c N_mod are reported in the sample sequences files for all the format.

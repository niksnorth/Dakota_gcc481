List of user-specified starting points
Description::
The \c multi_start meta-iterator must specify a sub-iterator using
either a \c method_pointer or a \c method_name plus optional \c
model_pointer.  This iterator is responsible for completing a series
of iterative analyses from a set of different starting points.  These
starting points can be specified as follows: (1) using \c
random_starts, for which the specified number of starting points are
selected randomly within the variable bounds, (2) using \c
starting_points, in which the starting values are provided in a list,
or (3) using both \c random_starts and \c starting_points, for which
the combined set of points will be used.

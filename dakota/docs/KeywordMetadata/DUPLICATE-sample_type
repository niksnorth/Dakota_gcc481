Selection of sampling strategy

Description::
The \c sample_type keyword allows the user to select between two types
of sampling: Monte Carlo (pure random) and Latin hypercube
(stratified) sampling.

The incremental keywords are deprecated; instead use \c samples
together with \c refinement_samples.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

If the \c sample_type keyword is present, it must be accompanied by \c
lhs or \c random.  In most contexts, \c lhs is the default (exception:
multilevel_sampling uses Monte Carlo by default).

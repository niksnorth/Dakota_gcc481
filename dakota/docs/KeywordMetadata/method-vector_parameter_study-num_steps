Number of sampling steps along the vector in a vector parameter study

Description::
\c num_steps defines the number of steps that are taken in the
direction of the vector. The magnitude of each step is determined in
conjuction with the rest of the method specification.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

The user is required to specify \c num_steps for a vector parameter
study.  There is no default value.

This study performs function evaluations at both ends, making the
total number of evaluations equal to \c num_steps+1.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

The study has stringent requirements on performing appropriate steps
with any discrete range and discrete set variables.  A \c num_steps
specification must result in discrete range and set index steps that
are integers: no remainder is currently permitted in the integer step
calculation and no rounding to integer steps will occur.

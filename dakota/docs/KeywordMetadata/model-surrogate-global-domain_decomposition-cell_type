Type of the Geometric Cells Used for the Piecewise Decomposition Option of Global Surrogates

Description:: 
The piecewise decomposition option for global surrogates is used to locally approximate a function at some point using a few sample points from its neighborhood.

This option requires a decomposition cell type that can vary from structured grid boxes, to polygonal Voronoi cells. Currently, this option only supports Voronoi cells.

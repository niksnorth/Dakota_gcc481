Blurb::
Selects free-form tabular file format for experiment data

Description::

A freeform tabular file is whitespace-separated text file with no
leading header row and no leading columns. For experiment data files,
each row contains data for configuration variables, observatiions,
and/or observation errors, depending on context.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

By default, Dakota imports tabular experiment data files in annotated
format.  Specify \c freeform to instead select this format.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

\li Prior to October 2011, calibration and surrogate data files were
in free-form format. They now default to \c annotated format, though \c
freeform remains an option.

\li When importing tabular data, a warning will be generated if a
specific number of data are expected, but extra is found and an error
generated when there is insufficient data.

Import a free-form experimental data file containing raw experiment
data in a calibration study

\verbatim
responses
  ...
  scalar_data_file 'shock_experiment.dat'
    freeform
\endverbatim

Example data file with two measured quantities, three experiments:
\verbatim
	18.23		83.21
	34.14		93.24
	22.41		88.92

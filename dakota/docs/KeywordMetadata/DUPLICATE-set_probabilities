Blurb:: This keyword defines the probabilities for the various elements 
of discrete sets.  
Description:: There are three types of \c discrete_uncertain_set variables: 
integer, string, or real sets.  With each of these types, one defines the number of elements of the set per that variable, the values of those elements, and the associated probabilities.  For example, if one has an integer discrete uncertain set variable with 3 elements {3,4,8}, then one could define the probabilities associated with those set elements as (for example) 0.2, 0.5, and 0.3. 
The \c set_probabilities for a particular variable should sum to one over all the elements in that set.

A subordinate local method provides periodic refinements to a top-level global method
Description::
In the \c embedded approach, a tightly-coupled hybrid is employed in
which a subordinate local method provides periodic refinements to a
top-level global method.

Global and local method strings supplied with the \c
global_method_pointer and \c local_method_pointer specifications
identify the two methods to be used. Alternatively, %Dakota method names
(e.g. '\ref method-soga') can be supplied using the \c global_method_name and 
\c local_method_name keywords, which each have optional model pointer
specifications. The \c local_search_probability setting is an optional 
specification for supplying the probability (between 0.0 and 1.0) of employing 
local search to improve estimates within the global search.

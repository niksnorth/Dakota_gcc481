Number of admissible elements for each set variable

Description::
Discrete set variables (including design, uncertain, and state) take
on only a fixed set of values.  For each type (integer, string, or
real), this keyword specifies how many admissible values are provided
for each variable.  If not specified, equal apportionment of elements
among variables is assumed, and the number of elements must be evenly
divisible by the number of variables.

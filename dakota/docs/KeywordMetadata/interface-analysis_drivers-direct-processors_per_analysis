Specify the number of processors per analysis when Dakota is run in parallel

Description::
For direct function interfaces, \c processors_per_analysis can be used
to specify multiprocessor analysis partitions. As with the \c
evaluation_servers, \c analysis_servers, \c
evaluation_self_scheduling, \c evaluation_static_scheduling, \c
analysis_self_scheduling, and \c analysis_static_scheduling
specifications, \c processors_per_analysis provides a means for the
user to override the automatic parallel configuration (refer to
ParallelLibrary and the Parallel Computing chapter of the Users Manual
\cite UsersMan) for the number of processors used for each analysis
partition.

<b>Usage Tips</b>
\li If both \c analysis_servers and \c processors_per_analysis are
    specified and they are not in agreement, then \c analysis_servers
    takes precedence.

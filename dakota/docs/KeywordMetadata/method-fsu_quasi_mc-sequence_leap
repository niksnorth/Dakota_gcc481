Specify how often the sequence is sampled
Description::
\c sequence_leap controls the "leaping" of 
terms in the sequence. The default is 1 for each variable, 
meaning that each term in the sequence be returned. 

Topics::	
Examples::
If the user specifies 
a sequence_leap of 2 for a variable, the points returned would be every other 
term from the QMC sequence. 

Theory::
The advantage to using a leap value greater than 
one is mainly for high-dimensional sets of random deviates. In this case, 
setting a leap value to the next prime number larger than the largest
prime base can help maintain uniformity when generating sample sets for high
dimensions. For more information about the efficacy of leaped 
Halton sequences, see \cite Robinson1999.

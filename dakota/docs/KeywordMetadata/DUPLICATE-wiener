Blurb::Use standard normal random variables (along with Hermite
orthogonal basis polynomials) when transforming to a standardized
probability space.

Description:: The Wiener option employs standard normal random
variables in a transformed probability space, corresponding to a
Hermite orthogonal polynomial basis.  This is the same nonlinear
variable transformation used by local and global reliability methods
(and therefore has the same variable support).

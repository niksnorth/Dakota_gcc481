Blurb::
Number of values at which to estimate desired statistics for each
response

Description::
The \c num_response_levels keyword allows the user to specify the number of response values, for each response, at which estimated statistics are of interest.  Statistics that can be computed are probabilities and reliabilities, both according to either a cumulative distribution function or a complementary cumulative distribution function.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

If \c num_response_levels is not specified, the response_levels will be evenly distributed among the responses.

<b> Expected Outputs </b>

The specific output will be determined by the type of statistics that are specified.  In a general sense, the output will be a list of response level-statistic pairs that show the estimated value of the desired statistic for each response level specified.

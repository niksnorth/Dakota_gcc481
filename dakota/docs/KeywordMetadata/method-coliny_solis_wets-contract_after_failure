Blurb::
The number of unsuccessful cycles prior to contraction.
Description::
In particular, \c coliny_solis_wets supports dynamic rescaling of the
step length, and dynamic rescaling of the constraint penalty. The only
new specification is \c contract_after_failure, which specifies the
number of unsuccessful cycles which must occur with a specific delta
prior to contraction of the delta.

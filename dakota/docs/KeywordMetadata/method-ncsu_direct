DIviding RECTangles method
Description::
North Carolina State University (NCSU) has an implementation of the
DIRECT algorithm (DIviding RECTangles algorithm that is outlined in
the SCOLIB method section above). This version is documented in
\cite Gab01 We have found that the NCSU DIRECT
implementation works better and is more robust for some problems than
\c coliny_direct. Currently, we maintain both versions of DIRECT in
%Dakota; in the future, we may deprecate one.

The NCSU DIRECT method is selected with \c ncsu_direct. We have tried
to maintain consistency between the keywords in SCOLIB and NCSU
implementation of DIRECT, but the algorithms have different
parameters, so the keywords sometimes have slightly different meaning.

<b> Stopping Criteria </b>

The algorithm stops based on:
-# \ref method-ncsu_direct-max_iterations - number of iterations
-# \ref method-ncsu_direct-max_function_evaluations - number of function evaluations
-# \ref method-ncsu_direct-solution_target and \ref method-ncsu_direct-convergence_tolerance
-# \ref method-ncsu_direct-min_boxsize_limit
-# \ref method-ncsu_direct-volume_boxsize_limit 

This method will always strictly respect the number of iterations, but
may slightly exceed the number of function evaluations, as it will
always explore all sub-rectangles at the current level.

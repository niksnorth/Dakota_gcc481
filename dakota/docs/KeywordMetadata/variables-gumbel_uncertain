Aleatory uncertain variable - gumbel
Description::
The Gumbel distribution is also referred to as the Type I Largest Extreme Value distribution. The distribution of maxima in sample sets from a population with a normal distribution will asymptotically converge to this distribution. It is commonly used to model demand variables such as wind loads and flood levels.

The density function for the Gumbel distribution is given by: 
\f[f(x) = \alpha e^{-\alpha(x-\beta)} exp(-e^{-\alpha(x-\beta)})\f]
where 
\f$\mu_{GU} = \beta + \frac{0.5772}{\alpha}\f$ 
and 
\f$\sigma_{GU} = \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{6}\alpha}\f$.

Theory::
When used with design of experiments and multidimensional parameter
studies, distribution bounds are inferred.
These bounds are [\f$\mu - 3 \sigma\f$, \f$\mu + 3 \sigma\f$]

For vector and centered parameter studies, an inferred initial
starting point is needed for the uncertain variables.
These variables are initialized to their means for these studies.

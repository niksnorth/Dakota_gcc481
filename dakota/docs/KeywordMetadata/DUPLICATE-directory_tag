Tag each work directory with the function evaluation number
Description::
If this keyword is used, Dakota will append a period and the function evaluation
number to the work directory names.

If this keyword is omitted, the default is no tagging, and the
same work directory will be used for ALL function evaluations.
Tagging is most useful when multiple
function evaluations are running simultaneously.

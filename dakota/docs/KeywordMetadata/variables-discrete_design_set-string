String-valued discrete design set variables

Description::
Discrete design variables whose values come from a specified set of
admissible strings.  The details of how to specify this discrete
variable are located on the \ref topic-discrete_variables page.  Each
string element value must be quoted and may contain alphanumeric,
dash, underscore, and colon. White space, quote characters, and
backslash/metacharacters are not permitted.

Topics:: 	discrete_variables, design_variables

Examples:: 
Two string variables whose values will be selected from the set of
provided elements. The first variable, 'linear solver', takes on
values from a set of three possible elements and the second variable,
'mesh_file', from a set of two possible elements.

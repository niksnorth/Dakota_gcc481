Export surrogate model to a plain-text archive file
Description::
After the surrogate model has been built, %Dakota will export it to a plain-text 
archival file suitable only for use with the surfpack executable (\c bin/surfpack).
The file is named using the pattern \c {prefix}.{response_descriptor}.sps, in which
'sps' stands for Surfpack Surrogate. See \c filename_prefix for further information 
about exported surrogate file naming. 

The %Dakota examples folder includes a demonstration of using the surfpack
executable with an exported model file.

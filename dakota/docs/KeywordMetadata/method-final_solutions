Number of designs returned as the best solutions
Description::
The \c final_solutions controls the number of final solutions 
returned by the iterator as the best solutions. 

For most optimizers, this is one, but some optimizers 
can produce multiple solutions (e.g. genetic algorithms). 

When using a \c hybrid strategy, the number of final 
solutions dictates how many solutions are passed from 
one method to another. 

<!---
Finally, the number 
of best solutions that will be passed from one iteration 
to another is governed by the iterator control 
\c final_solutions. If this is not specified, the 
surrogate-based global method will take all of the 
solutions available (e.g. all of the solutions 
in the Pareto front).

Examples::
In the case of sampling methods, if one 
specifies 100 samples (for example) but also specifies
\c final_solutions = 5, the five best solutions (in 
order of lowest response function value) are returned.

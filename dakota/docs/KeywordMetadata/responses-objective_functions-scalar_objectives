Blurb::  Number of scalar objective functions
Description::
This keyword describes the number of scalar objective functions. 
It is meant to be used in conjunction with \c field_objectives, which describes
the number of field objectives functions.  The total number of objective 
functions, both scalar and field, is given by \c objective_functions.  
If only scalar objective functions are specified, it is not necessary 
to specify the number of scalar terms explicitly:  one can simply 
say \c objective_functions = 5 and get 5 scalar objectives. 
However, if there are three scalar objectives and 2 field objectives, then 
\c objective_functions = 5 but \c scalar_objectives = 3 and \c field_objectives = 2. 

Objective functions are responses that are used with optimization 
methods in Dakota.  Currently, each term in a field objective is added 
to the total objective function presented to the optimizer.  For example, 
if you have one field objective with 100 terms (e.g. a time-temperature trace 
with 100 time points and 100 corresponding temperature points), the 100 temperature values 
will be added to create the overall objective.

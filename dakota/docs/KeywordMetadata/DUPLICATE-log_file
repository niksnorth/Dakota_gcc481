Specify the name of a log file
Description::
New as
of JEGA v2.0 is the introduction of the \c log_file specification. JEGA now
uses a logging library to output messages and status to the user. JEGA can be
configured at build time to log to both the console window and a text file, one
or the other, or neither. The \c log_file input is a string name of a file
into which to log. If the build was configured without file logging in JEGA,
this input is ignored. If file logging is enabled and no \c log_file is
specified, the default file name of JEGAGlobal.log is used.

Finite Difference Newton optimization method
Description::
This is a Newton method that expects a gradient and computes a
finite-difference approximation to the Hessian.  Each of the
Newton-based methods are automatically bound to the appropriate OPT++
algorithm based on the user constraint specification (unconstrained,
bound-constrained, or generally-constrained). In the
generally-constrained case, the Newton methods use a nonlinear
interior-point approach to manage the constraints.

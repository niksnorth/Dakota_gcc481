Blurb::
Combine middle of one parent with end of another
Description::
Two-point crossover divides each parent into
three regions, where offspring are created from the combination of the
middle region from one parent and the end regions from the other
parent.  Since the SCOLIB EA does not utilize bit representations of
variable values, the crossover points only occur on coordinate
boundaries, never within the bits of a particular coordinate.

Aleatory uncertain variable - Frechet
Description::
The Frechet distribution is also referred to as the Type II Largest Extreme Value distribution. 
The distribution of maxima in sample sets from a population with a lognormal distribution will asymptotically converge to this distribution. It is commonly used to model non-negative demand variables.

The density function for the frechet distribution is: 
\f[f(x) = \frac{\alpha}{\beta}(\frac{\beta}{x})^{\alpha+1}e^{-(\frac{\beta}{x})^\alpha}\f]
where \f$\mu_F = \beta\Gamma(1-\frac{1}{\alpha})\f$ and 
\f$\sigma_F^2 = \beta^2[\Gamma(1-\frac{2}{\alpha})-\Gamma^2(1-\frac{1}{\alpha})]\f$

Theory::
When used with design of experiments and multidimensional parameter
studies, distribution bounds are inferred.
These bounds are [0, \f$\mu + 3 \sigma\f$].

For vector and centered parameter studies, an inferred initial
starting point is needed for the uncertain variables.
These variables are initialized to their means for these studies.

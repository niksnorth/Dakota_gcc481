Multiplier for the penalty function
Description::
Most SCOLIB optimizers treat constraints with a simple penalty scheme
that adds \c constraint_penalty times the sum of squares of the
constraint violations to the objective function. The default value of 
\c constraint_penalty is 1000.0, except for methods that dynamically 
adapt their constraint penalty, for which the default value is 1.0.

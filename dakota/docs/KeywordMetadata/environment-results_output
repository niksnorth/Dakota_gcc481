Blurb:: (Experimental) Write a summary file containing the final results

Description::
(Experimental) Final results from a %Dakota study can be output to
dakota_results.txt by specifying \c results_output (optionally
specifying an alternate file name with \c
results_output_filename). The current experimental text file format is
hierarchical and a precursor to planned output to structured text
formats such as XML or YAML, and binary formats such as HDF5. The
contents, organization, and format of results files are all under
active development and are subject to change.

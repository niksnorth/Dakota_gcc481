Set method options not available through Dakota spec
Description::
All SCOLIB methods support the \c show_misc_options optional
specification which results in a dump of all the allowable method
inputs.  Note that the information provided by this command refers to
optimizer parameters that are internal to SCOLIB, and which may differ
from corresponding parameters used by the %Dakota interface.  The \c
misc_options optional specification provides a means for inputing
additional settings supported by the SCOLIB methods but which are not
currently mapped through the %Dakota input specification. Care must be
taken in using this specification; they should only be employed by
users familiar with the full range of parameter specifications
available directly from SCOLIB and understand any differences that
exist between those specifications and the ones available through
%Dakota.

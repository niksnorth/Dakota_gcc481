Specify the command Dakota uses to launch analysis driver(s) and filters

Description::

The typical commands that Dakota uses to launch analysis drivers are:
<!----
\verbatim
> input_filter parameters_file_name results_file_name 
> analysis_driver parameters_file_name results_file_name 
> output_filter parameters_file_name results_file_name 
\endverbatim

khu 140925 - i removed references to filters, because I don't think they are working.
---->
\verbatim
> analysis_driver parameters_file_name results_file_name 
\endverbatim
Dakota will automatically arrange the executables and file names.

If the analysis driver requires a different syntax, the entire
command can be specified as the analysis driver and the 
\c verbatim keyword will tell Dakota to use this as the command.

Note, this will not allow the use of \c file_tag, because the
exact command must be specified.

For additional information on invocation syntax, see the Interfaces
chapter of the Users Manual \cite UsersMan.

Examples::
In the following example, the analysis_driver command is run without any edits from Dakota.
\verbatim
interface
  analysis_driver = "matlab -nodesktop -nojvm -r 'MatlabDriver_hardcoded_filenames; exit' "
    fork
      parameters_file 'params.in'
      results_file 'results.out'
      verbatim # this tells Dakota to fork the command exactly as written, instead of appending I/O filenames
\endverbatim
The -r flag identifies the commands that will be run by matlab. The Matlab script has the 
parameters_file and results_file names hardcoded, so no additional arguments are required.

Use coordinate directions as search pattern
Description::
The particular form of the search pattern is controlled by the \c
pattern_basis specification.  If \c pattern_basis is \c coordinate
basis, then the pattern search uses a plus and minus offset in each
coordinate direction, for a total of \e 2n function evaluations in the
pattern.  This case is depicted in Figure 5.3 for three coordinate
dimensions.

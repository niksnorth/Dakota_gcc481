Offers an alternative to Markov Chain Monte Carlo-based Bayesian
inference.  This is a nascent capability, not yet ready for production
use.

<b>Usage Guidelines:</b> The WASABI method requires an emulator model.

<b>Attention: </b> While the \c emulator specification for WASABI
includes the keyword posterior_adaptive, it is not yet operational.

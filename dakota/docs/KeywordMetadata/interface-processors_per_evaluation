Specify the number of processors per evaluation server when Dakota is run in parallel
Description::
The optional \c processors_per_evaluation specification supports user override
of the automatic parallel configuration for the number of processors in each
evaluation server. That is, if the automatic configuration is
undesirable for some reason, the user can enforce a desired server size
at the evaluation parallelism level. Refer to ParallelLibrary 
and the Parallel Computing chapter of the Users Manual 
\cite UsersMan for additional information.

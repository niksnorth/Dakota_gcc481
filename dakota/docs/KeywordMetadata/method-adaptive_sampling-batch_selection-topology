Blurb::
In this selection strategy, we use information about the topology of the space 
from the Morse-Smale complex to identify next points to select. 
Description::
In this strategy we look at the topology of the scoring function and select the
\c n highest maxima in the topology. To determine local maxima, we construct the
approximate Morse-Smale complex. This strategy does require the user to have the 
Morse-Smale package.

Selects annotated tabular file format

Description::
An annotated tabular file is a whitespace-separated text file with one
leading header row of comments/column labels.  Each subsequent row
contains an evaluation ID and interface ID, followed by data for
variables, or variables followed by responses, depending on context.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

By default, Dakota imports and exports tabular files in annotated
format.  The \c annotated keyword can be used to explicitly specify
this.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

\li To specify pre-Dakota 6.1 tabular format, which did not include
interface_id, specify \c custom_annotated \c header \c eval_id

\li Prior to October 2011, calibration and surrogate data files were
in free-form format. They now default to \c annotated format, though \c
freeform remains an option.

\li When importing tabular data, a warning will be generated if a
specific number of data are expected, but extra is found and an error
generated when there is insufficient data.

\li Some TPLs like SCOLIB and JEGA manage their own file I/O and only
support the \c freeform option.

Examples::

Export an annotated top-level tabular data file containing a header
row, leading eval_id and interface_id columns, and data for variables
and responses.  Input file fragment:
\verbatim
environment
  tabular_data
    tabular_data_file = 'dakota_summary.dat'
    annotated
\endverbatim
Resulting tabular file:
\verbatim
%eval_id interface             x1             x2         obj_fn nln_ineq_con_1 nln_ineq_con_2 
1            NO_ID            0.9            1.1         0.0002           0.26           0.76 
2            NO_ID        0.90009            1.1 0.0001996404857   0.2601620081       0.759955 
3            NO_ID        0.89991            1.1 0.0002003604863   0.2598380081       0.760045 
...
\endverbatim

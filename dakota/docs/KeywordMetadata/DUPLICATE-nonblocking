Blurb::
Evaluate points in the pattern until an improving point is found
Description::

In the \c nonblocking case, all points in the pattern may not be evaluated. 
The first improving point found becomes the next iterate. Since 
the algorithm steps will be subject to parallel timing variabilities, 
these runs will not generally be repeatable.

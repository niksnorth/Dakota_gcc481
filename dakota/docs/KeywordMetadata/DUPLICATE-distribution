Selection of cumulative or complementary cumulative functions

Description::
The \c distribution keyword allows the user to select between a
cumulative distribution/belief/plausibility function and a
complementary cumulative distribution/belief/plausibility function.
This choice affects how probabilities and reliability indices are
reported.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

If the \c distribution keyword is present, it must be accompanied by
either \c cumulative or \c complementary.  Otherwise, a cumulative
distribution will be used by default.

<b> Expected Outputs </b>

Output will be a set of model response-probability pairs determined
according to the choice of distribution. The choice of distribution
also defines the sign of the reliability or generalized reliability
indices.

Blurb::
Specify a percent of the response variance that should be captured with the random field representation.
THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL CAPABILITY. 

Description::
This control allows the user to specify the percent variance to be 
capture in the random field representation (e.g. either a Karhunen-Loeve or Principal Components expansion). 
Typically, the user would specify something like 0.9 or 0.95, where 0.9 means that 90% 
of the variance of the response field will be captured by the random field. 
THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL CAPABILITY UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT. 

<b> Default Behavior </b>
If the user specifies neither \c trunction_tolerance nor \c expansion_bases, then 
the truncation tolerance is set to 0.95 and
the number of expansion bases that captures 95% of the variance will be used.

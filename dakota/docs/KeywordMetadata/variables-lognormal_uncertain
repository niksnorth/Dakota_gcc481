Aleatory uncertain variable - lognormal
Description::
If the logarithm of an uncertain variable X has a normal distribution, that is 
\f$\log X \sim N(\mu,\sigma)\f$,
then X is distributed with a lognormal distribution. 
The lognormal is often used to model:
-# time to perform some task
-# variables which are the product of a large number of other quantities, by the Central Limit Theorem
-# quantities which cannot have negative values. 

Within the lognormal uncertain optional group specification, the number of lognormal uncertain variables, the means, and either standard deviations or error factors must be specified, and the distribution lower and upper bounds and variable descriptors are optional specifications. These distribution bounds can be used to truncate the tails of lognormal distributions, which as for bounded normal, can result in the mean and the standard deviation of the sample data being different from the mean and standard deviation of the underlying distribution (see "bounded lognormal" and "bounded lognormal-n" distribution types in \cite Wyss1998). 

For the lognormal variables, one may specify either the mean 
\f$\mu\f$
and standard deviation 
\f$\sigma\f$ 
of the actual lognormal distribution (option 1), the mean 
\f$\mu\f$
 and error factor 
\f$\epsilon\f$ 
of the actual lognormal distribution (option 2), or the mean 
\f$\lambda\f$ ("lambda") 
and standard deviation 
\f$\zeta\f$ ("zeta") 
of the underlying normal distribution (option 3).
<!-- This approach diverges from that of \cite Wyss1998, which assumes that a specification of mean and standard deviation provides parameters of the underlying normal distribution, and a specification of mean and error factor provides statistics of the actual lognormal distribution. --> 

The conversion equations from lognormal mean
\f$\mu\f$ and either lognormal error factor 
\f$\epsilon\f$
or lognormal standard deviation 
\f$\sigma\f$
to the mean 
\f$\lambda\f$
and standard deviation 
\f$\zeta\f$
of the underlying normal distribution are as follows:

\f[\zeta = \frac{ln(\epsilon)}{1.645}\f]
\f[\zeta^2 = ln(\frac{\sigma^2}{\mu^2} + 1)\f]
\f[\lambda = ln(\mu) - \frac{\zeta^2}{2}\f]

Conversions from \f$\lambda\f$ and \f$\zeta\f$ back to \f$\mu\f$ 
and \f$\epsilon\f$ or \f$\sigma\f$ are as follows:

\f[\mu = e^{\lambda + \frac{\zeta^2}{2}}\f]
\f[\sigma^2 = e^{2\lambda + \zeta^2}(e^{\zeta^2} - 1)\f]
\f[\epsilon = e^{1.645\zeta}\f]

The density function for the lognormal distribution is: 
\f[f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\zeta x} e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{ln x-\lambda}{\zeta}\right)^2}\f]

Examples::
Theory::
When used with design of experiments and multidimensional parameter
studies, distribution bounds are inferred.
These bounds are [0, \f$\mu + 3 \sigma\f$].

For vector and centered parameter studies, an inferred initial
starting point is needed for the uncertain variables.
These variables are initialized to their means for these studies.

Selects custom-annotated tabular file format for experiment data

Description::

A custom-annotated tabular file is a whitespace-separated text file
containing experiment data, including configuration variables,
observatiions, and/or observation errors, depending on context.  For
experiment import, custom-annotated allows user options for whether \c
header row and \c exp_id column appear in the tabular file, thus
bridging \c freeform and (fully) \c annotated.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

By default, Dakota imports tabular experiment data files in annotated
format.  The \c custom_annotated keyword, followed by options can be
used to select other formats.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

\li Prior to October 2011, calibration and surrogate data files were
in free-form format. They now default to \c annotated format, though \c
freeform remains an option.

\li When importing tabular data, a warning will be generated if a
specific number of data are expected, but extra is found and an error
generated when there is insufficient data.

Examples::

Import an experimental data file containing a header row, no leading
exp_id column, and experiment data in a calibration study

\verbatim
responses
  ...
  scalar_data_file 'shock_experiment.dat'
    custom_annotated header
\endverbatim

Example data file with two measured quantities, three experiments:
\verbatim
%	velocity	stress
	18.23		83.21
	34.14		93.24
	22.41		88.92
\endverbatim

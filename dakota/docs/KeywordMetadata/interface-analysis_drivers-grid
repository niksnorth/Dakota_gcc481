Blurb:: Deprecated grid computing interface

Description::
Interface Dakota directly to a grid (distributed) computing engine.
This deprecated capability was historically used for interfaces with
IDEA and JAVASpaces in the past and was intended as a placeholder for
future work with Condor and/or Globus services. It is not currently
operational.

<!-- For grid interfaces, no additional specifications are used at
this time.  \c hostnames and \c processors_per_host are additional
settings within the required group. The \c hostnames specification
provides a list of machines for use in distributing evaluations, and
the \c processors_per_host specification provides the number of
processors to use from each host. -->

Create new population using replacement
Description::
The \c replacement_type controls how current populations and newly
generated individuals are combined to create a new population.  Each
of the \c replacement_type selections accepts an integer value, which
is referred as the \c replacement_size:

The \c chc setting creates a new population using (a) the \c
replacement_size best individuals from the \e combination of the
current population and the newly generated individuals, and (b) \c
population_size - \c replacement_size individuals randomly selected
from among the remaining individuals in this combined pool.  The \c
chc setting is the preferred selection for many engineering problems.

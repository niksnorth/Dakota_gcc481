Use the surrogate based optimization method
Description::
A surrogate-based optimization method will be used.  The surrogate
employed in \c sbo is a Gaussian process surrogate.

The main difference between \c ego and the 
\c sbo approach is the objective function being optimized. 
\c ego relies on an expected improvement function, while in 
\c sbo, the optimization proceeds using an evolutionary 
algorithm (\ref method-coliny_ea) on the Gaussian process surrogate:
it is a standard surrogate-based optimization. Also note that the \c
sbo option can support optimization over discrete variables (the
discrete variables are relaxed) while \c ego cannot.

This is not the same as \ref method-surrogate_based_global.

Stopping Criterion based on shortest edge of hyperrectangle
Description::
\c min_boxsize_limit is a setting that terminates the optimization
when the measure of a hyperrectangle S with f(c(S)) = fmin is less
than min_boxsize_limit.

Each subregion considered by DIRECT has a \b size, which corresponds
to the longest diagonal of the subregion.

\c min_boxsize_limit specification terminates DIRECT if the size of
the smallest subregion falls below this threshold.

In practice, this specification is likely to be more effective at
limiting DIRECT's search.

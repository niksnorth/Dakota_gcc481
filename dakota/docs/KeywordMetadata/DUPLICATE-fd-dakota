Blurb::
(Default) Use internal Dakota finite differences algorithm
Description::
The \c dakota routine is the default since it can execute
in parallel and exploit the concurrency in finite difference
evaluations (see Exploiting Parallelism in the Users Manual 
\cite UsersMan).

When the \c method_source is \c dakota, the user may also specify the
type of scaling desired when determining the finite difference step
size. The choices are \c absolute, \c bounds, and \c relative. For
\c absolute, the step size will be applied as is. For \c bounds, it
will be scaled by the range of each parameter. For \c relative, it
will be scaled by the parameter value.

Verify the quality of analytic gradients

Description::
\c verify_level instructs the NPSOL and NLSSOL algorithms to perform
their own finite difference verification of the gradients provided by
Dakota.  Typically these are used to verify \c analytic_gradients
produced by a simulation code, though the option can be used with
other Dakota-supplied gradient types including numerical or mixed.

Level 1 will verify the objective gradients, level 2, the nonlinear
constraint gradients, and level 3, both.  See the Optional Input
Parameters section of the NPSOL manual  \cite Gil86 for additional
information, including options to verify at the user-supplied initial
point vs. first feasible point.

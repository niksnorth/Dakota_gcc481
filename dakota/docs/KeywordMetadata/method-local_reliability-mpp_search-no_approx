Perform MPP search on original response functions (use no approximation)
Description::   
This mpp_search option performs the MPP search on the original response functions 
without the use of any approximations.  Note that the use of the no_approx MPP search with 
first-order probability integration results in the traditional reliability method called FORM 
(First-Order Reliability Method).  Similarly, the use of no_approx with second-order 
probability integration results in SORM (Second-Order Reliability Method).

Define the characteristic values to scale linear equalities
Description::
Each entry in \c linear_equality_scales may be a
user-specified, nonzero characteristic value to be used in scaling each
constraint. 

See the scaling keyword in the \ref method section for details on how to use this keyword.

Scaling for linear constraints is
applied \e after any continuous variable scaling.

For example, for
variable scaling on continuous design variables x: \f[ \tilde{x}^j =
\frac{x^j - x^j_O}{x^j_M} \f] we have the following system for linear
inequality constraints \f[ a_L \leq A_i x \leq a_U \f] \f[ a_L \leq
A_i \left( \mathrm{diag}(x_M) \tilde{x} + x_O \right) \leq a_U \f] \f[
a_L - A_i x_O \leq A_i \mathrm{diag}(x_M) \tilde{x} \leq a_U - A_i x_O
\f] \f[ \tilde{a}_L \leq \tilde{A}_i \tilde{x} \leq \tilde{a}_U \f]
and user-specified or automatically computed scaling multipliers are
appplied to this final transformed system, which accounts for
continuous design variable scaling. When automatic scaling is in use
for linear constraints they are linearly scaled by a computed
characteristic value, but not affinely to [0,1].

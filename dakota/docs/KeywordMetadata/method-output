Blurb::
Control how much method information is written to the screen and output file
Description::
Choose from a total of five output levels during the course of a Dakota study. 
If there is no user specification for output verbosity, then the default 
setting is \c normal. 

Specific mappings are as follows:
\li \c silent (i.e., really quiet):
  silent iterators, silent model, silent interface, quiet approximation,
  quiet file operations
\li \c quiet:
  quiet iterators, quiet model, quiet interface, quiet approximation,
  quiet file operations
\li \c normal:
  normal iterators, normal model, normal interface, quiet approximation,
  quiet file operations
\li \c verbose:
  verbose iterators, normal model, verbose interface, verbose approximation,
  verbose file operations
\li \c debug (i.e., really verbose):
  debug iterators, normal model, debug interface, verbose approximation,
  verbose file operations

Note that iterators and interfaces utilize the full granularity in verbosity, 
whereas models, approximations, and file operations do not. 
With respect to iterator verbosity, different iterators implement this control 
in slightly different ways (as described below in the method independent 
controls descriptions for each iterator), however the meaning is consistent. 

For models, interfaces, approximations, and file operations, \c quiet 
suppresses parameter and response set reporting and \c silent further 
suppresses function evaluation headers and scheduling output. Similarly, 
\c verbose adds file management, approximation evaluation, and global 
approximation coefficient details, and \c debug further adds diagnostics 
from nonblocking schedulers.

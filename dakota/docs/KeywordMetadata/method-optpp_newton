Newton method based optimization
Description::

This is a full Newton method that expects a gradient and a Hessian.
Each of the Newton-based methods are automatically bound to the
appropriate OPT++ algorithm based on the user constraint specification
(unconstrained, bound-constrained, or generally-constrained). In the
generally-constrained case, the Newton methods use a nonlinear
interior-point approach to manage the constraints.

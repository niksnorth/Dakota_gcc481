Recommended Tools
-----------------
Last known good tool versions (build only known to work on RHEL)
  doxygen-1.5.1   required to generate .dox to latex, html, and man for 
                  reference and developer manuals
  perl-5.10.1	  required to generate test file excerpts and dprepro usage
  		  for user manual
  tetex-3.0-33.8  required to generate PDF of any of the four manuals

Process
-------
Configuring with
  ENABLE_DAKOTA_DOCS:BOOL=ON
will enable a number of helpful make targets.  These are designed to
replace previous manual processess for compiling docs.  Dependencies
are expressed, so, e.g., making the docs-pdf-ref target will
automatically run the doxygen step for you.

docs: make the most common docs needed by developers:
  docs-doxygen
  docs-pdf-user
  docs-pdf-theory

docs-doxygen: doxygen steps only for dev/ref (will resolve cross-references)

docs-pdf: generate PDFs of all four manuals, or individually:
  docs-pdf-dev
  docs-pdf-ref
  docs-pdf-user
  docs-pdf-theory

docs-sand: generate SAND report PDFs of all four manuals, or individually:
  docs-sand-dev
  docs-sand-ref
  docs-sand-user
  docs-sand-theory

"Full" versions of manuals
--------------------------
To build using
  SAND-full-users.tex
  header-ref-SAND-full.tex
  header-dev-SAND-full.tex
which offer an alternative to the shell with included PDF; likely
copy the .tex and the SNL style files to the manual directory and
pdflatex there (not presently used)

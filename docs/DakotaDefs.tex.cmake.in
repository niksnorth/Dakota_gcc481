% Fragments which together comprise abstracts

\newcommand{\DakotaAbstractShared}{
The Dakota toolkit provides a flexible and extensible interface
between simulation codes and iterative analysis methods. Dakota 
contains algorithms for optimization with gradient and
nongradient-based methods; uncertainty quantification with sampling,
reliability, and stochastic expansion methods; parameter
estimation with nonlinear least squares methods; and
sensitivity/variance analysis with design of experiments and parameter
study methods. These capabilities may be used on their own or as
components within advanced strategies such as surrogate-based
optimization, mixed integer nonlinear programming, or optimization
under uncertainty. By employing object-oriented design to implement
abstractions of the key components required for iterative systems
analyses, the Dakota toolkit provides a flexible and extensible
problem-solving environment for design and performance analysis of
computational models on high performance computers.

\newcommand{\DakotaAbstractDev}{
This report describes the Dakota class hierarchies. It is derived 
from annotation of the source code and provides detailed class 
documentation, including all member functions and attributes.  
}

\newcommand{\DakotaAbstractRef}{
This report serves as a reference manual for the commands specification
for the Dakota software, providing input overviews, option descriptions,
and example specifications.
}

\newcommand{\DakotaAbstractUsers}{
This report serves as a user's manual for the Dakota software and
provides capability overviews and procedures for software execution,
as well as a variety of example studies.
}

\newcommand{\DakotaAbstractTheory}{
This report serves as a theoretical manual for selected algorithms
implemented within the Dakota software.  It is not intended as a
comprehensive theoretical treatment, since a number of existing texts
cover general optimization theory, statistical analysis, and other
introductory topics.  Rather, this manual is intended to summarize a
set of Dakota-related research publications in the areas of
surrogate-based optimization, uncertainty quantification, and
optimization under uncertainty that provide the foundation for many 
of Dakota's iterative analysis capabilities.

Blurb::
Keep the parameters & results files after the analysis driver completes
Description::
If \c file_save is used, Dakota will not delete the parameters and
results files after the function evaluation is completed.

The default behavior is NOT to save these files.

If \c file_tag is not specified and the saved files would be overwritten
by a future evaluation, Dakota renames them after the analysis driver has
run by tagging them with the evaluation number.

File saving is most useful when debugging the
data communication between %Dakota and the simulation.

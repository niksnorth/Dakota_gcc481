Use the Efficient Global Optimization method
Description::
In the case of \c ego, the efficient global optimization (EGO) method
is used to calculate bounds. By default, the Surfpack GP (Kriging)
model is used, but the %Dakota implementation may be selected
instead. If \c use_derivatives is specified the GP model will be built
using available derivative data (Surfpack GP only).

See \ref method-efficient_global for more information.

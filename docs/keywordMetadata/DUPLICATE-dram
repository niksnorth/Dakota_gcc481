Blurb::  Use the DRAM MCMC algorithm

Description::  
The type of Markov Chain Monte Carlo used.  This keyword specifies the
use of DRAM, (Delayed Rejection Adaptive Metropolis) \cite Haario.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

Five MCMC algorithm variants are supported: \c dram, \c
delayed_rejection, \c adaptive_metropolis, \c metropolis_hastings, and
\c multilevel.  The default is \c dram.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

If the user knows very little about the proposal covariance, using
dram is a recommended strategy.  The proposal covariance is adaptively
updated, and the delayed rejection may help improve low acceptance
rates.

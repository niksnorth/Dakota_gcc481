Exports surrogate model in user-selected format

Description::
Export the surrogate for later evaluation using the surfpack exectuable 
(\c bin/surfpack) or a user-developed tool. Export format is controlled
using the \c formats specification. Four formats are available in %Dakota;
however, not all have been enabled for all surrogates.

The four formats are:
<ul> 
 <li>\c text_archive - Plain-text, machine-readable archive for use with 
  the surfpack executable</li>
 <li>\c binary_archive - Binary, machine-readable archive for use with the 
  surfpack executable</li>
 <li>\c algebraic_file - Plain-text, human-readable file intended for use with 
  user-created tools; not compatible with the surfpack executable</li>
 <li>\c algebraic_console - Print the model in algebraic format to the 
  screen; not compatible with the surfpack executable</li>
</ul>

Most global surrogates can be exported in all four formats. These include:
<ul>
 <li> Gaussian process (keyword \c gaussian_process surfpack)</li>
 <li> Artificial neural network (keyword \c neural_network)</li>
 <li> Radial basis Funtions (keyword \c radial_basis)</li>
 <li> Polynomial (keyword \c polynomial)</li>
</ul>

However, for Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (keyword \c mars)
and moving least squares (keyword \c moving_least_squares) models, 
only \c text_archive and \c binary_archive formats may be used.

Currently, no other surrogate models can be exported. In addition, %Dakota
cannot import models that have been exported. They are strictly for use
with external tools.

<b> Default Behavior </b>
<p>No export.


<b> Expected Output </b>
<p>Output depends on selected format; see the \c formats specification.

<b> Additional Discussion </b>
<p>The %Dakota examples folder includes a demonstration of using the surfpack
executable with an exported model file.

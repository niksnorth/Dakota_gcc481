Selection of statistics to compute at each response level

Description::
The \c compute keyword is used to select which forward stastical mapping is calculated
at each response level.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

If \c response_levels is not specified, no statistics are computed. If \c response_levels is specified but \c compute is not, probabilities will be computed by default. If both \c response_levels and \c compute are specified, then on of the following must be specified: \c probabilities, \c reliabilities, or \c gen_reliabilities.

<b> Expected Output </b>

The type of statistics specified by \c compute will be reported for each response level.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

CDF/CCDF probabilities are calculated for specified response levels
using a simple binning approach. 

CDF/CCDF reliabilities are calculated for specified response levels by
computing the number of sample standard deviations separating the
sample mean from the response level.

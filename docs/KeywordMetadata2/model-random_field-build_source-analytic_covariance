Blurb::
Use an analytic covariance function for the purposes 
of generating a random field model. 
THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL CAPABILITY. 

Description::
As part of the capability to generate a random field representation, the user 
needs to specify the data used to generate the random field representation. 
If \c analytic_covariance is specified, an analytic covariance function will be used to generate instantiations 
of a random field over a mesh. 
The form of the covariance function must be specified (e.g. \c exponential or \c squared_exponential.
THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL CAPABILITY UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT. 

<b> Default Behavior </b>
Currently, the \c build_source that is fully working is the 
\c dace_method_pointer.  The others are not fully operational.

Blurb::  Use the Delayed Rejection MCMC algorithm 

Description::  
This keyword specifies the use of the Delayed Rejection algorithm in
which there can be a delay in rejecting samples from the chain.  That
is, the "DR" part of DRAM is used but the "AM" part is not, rather a
regular Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is used.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

Five MCMC algorithm variants are supported: \c dram, \c
delayed_rejection, \c adaptive_metropolis, \c metropolis_hastings, and
\c multilevel.  The default is \c dram.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

If the user knows something about the proposal covariance or the
proposal covariance is informed through derivative information, using
\c delayed_rejection is preferred over \c dram: the proposal covariance is
already being informed by derivative information and the adaptive
metropolis is not necessary.

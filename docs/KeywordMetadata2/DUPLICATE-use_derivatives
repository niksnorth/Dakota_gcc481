Use derivative data to construct surrogate models

Description::
The \c use_derivatives flag specifies that any available derivative
information should be used in global approximation builds, for those
global surrogate types that support it (currently, polynomial
regression and the Surfpack Gaussian process).

However, it's use with Surfpack Gaussian process is not recommended.

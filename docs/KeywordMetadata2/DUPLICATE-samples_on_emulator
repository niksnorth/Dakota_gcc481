Blurb::
Number of samples at which to evaluate an emulator (surrogate)

Description::
How many approximate function evaluations to perform on the emulator
model, e.g., to compute statistics

<b> Default Behavior </b>

The default number of samples is method-dependent.

Topics::	

Examples::
Perform 10000 samples on the PCE approximation of the true model:
\verbatim
method
  polynomial_chaos
    quadrature_order    = 2
    samples_on_emulator = 10000
\endverbatim

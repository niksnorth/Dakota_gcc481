Integer valued point histogram variable

Description::
This probability mass function is integer-valued; the abscissa values
must all be integers.  The \c n abscissa values are paired with \c n
\c counts which indicate the relative frequency (mass) of each integer
relative to the other specified integers.

Examples::
\verbatim
histogram_point_uncertain
  integer = 2
  pairs_per_variable = 2     3 
  abscissas          = 3 4   100 200 300
  counts             = 1 1   1   2   1
\endverbatim

There are two variables, the first one has two possible integer values
which are equally probable.  The second one has three options, and 200
is twice as probable as either 100 or 300.

Specify the number of evaluation servers when Dakota is run in parallel

Description::
The optional \c evaluation_servers specification supports user
override of the automatic parallel configuration for the number of
evaluation servers. That is, if the automatic configuration is
undesirable for some reason, the user can enforce a desired number of
partitions at the evaluation parallelism level. Refer to
ParallelLibrary and the Parallel Computing chapter of the Users Manual
\cite UsersMan for additional information.

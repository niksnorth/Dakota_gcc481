Aleatory uncertain variable - exponential
Description::
The exponential distribution is often used for modeling failure rates. 

The density function for the exponential distribution is given by: 
\f[f(x) = \frac{1}{\beta} e^{\frac{-x}{\beta}}\f] 
where 
\f$\mu_{E} = \beta\f$ and \f$\sigma^2_{E} = \beta^2\f$. 


Note that 
this distribution is a special case of the more general gamma distribution.

Theory::
When used with design of experiments and multidimensional parameter
studies, distribution bounds are inferred.
These bounds are [0, \f$\mu + 3 \sigma\f$].

For vector and centered parameter studies, an inferred initial
starting point is needed for the uncertain variables.
These variables are initialized to their means for these studies.

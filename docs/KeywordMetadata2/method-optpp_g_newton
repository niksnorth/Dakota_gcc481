Newton method based least-squares calbration
Description::
The Gauss-Newton algorithm is available as \c optpp_g_newton and
supports unconstrained, bound-constrained, and generally-constrained
problems. When interfaced with the unconstrained, bound-constrained,
and nonlinear interior point full-Newton optimizers from the OPT++
library, it provides a Gauss-Newton least squares capability which --
on zero-residual test problems -- can exhibit quadratic convergence
rates near the solution.  (Real problems almost never have zero
residuals, i.e., perfect fits.)

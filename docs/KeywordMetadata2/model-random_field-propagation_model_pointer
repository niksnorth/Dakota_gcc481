Blurb::
Pointer to the model that will accept realizations of the random field and use them for subsequent analysis. 
Typcially, this model will take the random field as inputs, e.g. a random field defining a pressure boundary or temperature boundary condition 
over a structure. 
THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL CAPABILITY. 

Description::
After a random field representation has been generated, Dakota will generate samples of that random field 
based on the representation.  These sample realizations can then be used to drive another 
set of simulation analyses.  The \c propagation_model_pointer
is the model on which the random field realizations will be propagated. 
THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL CAPABILITY UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT.

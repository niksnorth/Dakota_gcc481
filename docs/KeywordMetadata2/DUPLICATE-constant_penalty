Use a simple weighted penalty to manage feasibility
Description::
Finally, constraint infeasibility can be managed in a somewhat more
sophisticated manner than the simple weighted penalty function.  If
the \c constant_penalty specification is used, then the simple
weighted penalty scheme described above is used.  Otherwise, the
constraint penalty is adapted to the value \c constraint_penalty/L,
where L is the the smallest step length used so far.

Change the optimization method used to compute hyperparameters
Description::
Select the optimization method to compute hyperparameters of the
Gaussian Process by specifying one of these arguments:
<ul>
<li> \c global (default) - DIRECT method
</li>
<li> \c local - CONMIN method
</li>
<li> \c sampling - generates several random guesses and 
   picks the candidate with greatest likelihood
</li>
<li> \c none - no optimization, pick the center of the feasible region
</li>
</ul>

The \c none option, and the starting location of the 
\c local optimization, default to the center, in 
log(correlation length) scale, of the of feasible region. 

Surfpack picks a small feasible region of correlation parameters.

Note that we have found the \c global 
optimization method to be the most robust.

Allow refinement of probability and generalized reliability results using importance sampling
Description::
The \c probability_refinement allows refinement of probability and generalized reliability results using importance sampling. If one specifies \c probability_refinement, there are some additional options.  One can specify which type of importance sampling to use (\c import, \c adapt_import, or \c mm_adapt_import). Additionally, one can specify the number of refinement samples to use with \c refinement_samples and the seed to use with \c seed.  

The \c probability_refinement density reweighting accounts originally 
was developed based on Gaussian distributions.  It now accounts for 
additional non-Gaussian cases.

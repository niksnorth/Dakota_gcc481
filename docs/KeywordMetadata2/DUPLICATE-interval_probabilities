Assign probability mass to each interval
Description::
The basic probability assignments for each interval variable must sum to one.
For example, if an interval variable is defined with three intervals, 
the probabilities for these intervals could be 0.2, 0.5, and 0.3 which sum to one, but could not be 0.5,0.5, and 0.5 which do not sum to one.

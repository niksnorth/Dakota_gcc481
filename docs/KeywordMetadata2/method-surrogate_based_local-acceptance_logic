Set criteria for trusted surrogate
Description::
Following calculation of the merit function for the new iterate, the
iterate is accepted or rejected and the trust region size is adjusted
for the next surrogate_based_local iteration. Iterate acceptance is
governed either by a trust region ratio (\c tr_ratio) formed from the
merit function values or by a filter method (\c filter); however,
trust region resizing logic is currently based only on the trust
region ratio. For infeasible iterates, constraint relaxation can be
used for balancing constraint satisfaction and progress made toward an
optimum.

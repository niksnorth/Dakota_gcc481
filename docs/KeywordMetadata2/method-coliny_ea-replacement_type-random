Create new population randomly 
Description::
The \c replacement_type controls how current populations and newly
generated individuals are combined to create a new population.  Each
of the \c replacement_type selections accepts an integer value, which
is referred as the \c replacement_size:

The \c random setting creates a new population using:
<ul>
<li> \c replacement_size randomly selected individuals from the current population, and </li>
<li> \c population_size - \c replacement_size individuals randomly selected from among 
the newly generated individuals (the number of which is optionally specified using 
\c new_solutions_generated) that are created for each generation (using the selection, 
crossover, and mutation procedures).</li>
</ul>

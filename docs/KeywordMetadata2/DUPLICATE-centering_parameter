Controls how closely the algorithm should follow the "central path"
Description::
The \c centering_parameter specification is a parameter (between 0 and
1) that controls how closely the algorithm should follow the "central
path".
See  \cite Wright1 for the definition of central
path. The larger the value, the more closely the algorithm follows the
central path, which results in small steps. A value of 0 indicates
that the algorithm will take a pure Newton step. Default values are
.2, .2, and .1 for the \c el_bakry, \c argaez_tapia, and \c van_shanno
merit functions, respectively.

The base name of the work directory created by Dakota

Description::  
The \c named keyword is followed by a string, indicating the name of
the work directory created by Dakota.  If relative, the work directory
will be created relative to the directory from which Dakota is
invoked.

If \c named is not used, the default work directory is a temporary
directory with a system-generated name (e.g., \c
/tmp/dakota_work_c93vb71z/).

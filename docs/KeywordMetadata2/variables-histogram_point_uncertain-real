Real valued point histogram variable

Description::
This probability mass function is real-valued; the abscissa values
must all be integers.  The \c n abscissa values are paired with \c n
\c counts which indicate the relative frequency (mass) of each real
relative to the other specified reals.

Examples::
\verbatim
histogram_point_uncertain
  real = 2
  pairs_per_variable = 2               3 
  abscissas          = 3.1415 4.5389   100 200.112345 300
  counts             = 1      1        1   2          1
\endverbatim

There are two variables, the first one has two possible real values
which are equally probable.  The second one has three possible real
value options, and 200.112345 is twice as probable as either 100 or
300.

Number of initial model evaluations used in build phase

Description:: 

The number of build points or training points used in the initial
phase of an algorithm or model construction.  Typically these are the
initial set of data points used to construct (train) a surrogate model
(emulator). If the number of \c build_samples is less than the minimum
number of points required to build the surrogate, Dakota will augment
the samples to obtain the minimum required.

Topics:: 

Examples:: 
Perform GP-based adaptive importance sampling, building the GP with
100 points and then performing 100 approxmiate evaluations to evaluate
the probability.

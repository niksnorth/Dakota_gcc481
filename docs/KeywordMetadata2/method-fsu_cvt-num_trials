Blurb::
The number of secondary sample points generated to adjust the location of the primary sample points
Description::
In general, the variable with the most influence 
on the quality of the final sample set is \c num_trials, 
which determines how well the Voronoi
subregions are sampled. 

Generally, \c num_trials should be "large", certainly much
bigger than the number of sample points being requested; 
a reasonable value might be 10,000, but values of 100,000 
or 1 million are not unusual.

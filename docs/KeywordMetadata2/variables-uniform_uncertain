Aleatory uncertain variable - uniform
Description::
Within the uniform uncertain optional group specification,
the number of uniform uncertain variables and the distribution lower and upper
bounds are required specifications, and variable descriptors is an optional specification. 
The uniform distribution has the density function:
\f[f(x) = \frac{1}{U_U-L_U}\f]
where 
\f$U_U\f$ and \f$L_U\f$ 
are the upper and lower bounds of the uniform distribution, respectively. The mean of the uniform distribution is 
\f$\frac{U_U+L_U}{2}\f$
 and the variance is 
\f$\frac{(U_U-L_U)^2}{12}\f$.

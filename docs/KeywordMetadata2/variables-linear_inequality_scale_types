Specify how each linear inequality constraint is scaled
Description::
\c linear_inequality_scale_types provide strings specifying
the scaling type for each linear inequality constraint,
in methods that support scaling.

An entry may be selected for each constraint. The options are:
\li <tt>'none'</tt> - no scaling
\li <tt>'value'</tt> - characteristic value
    if this is chosen, then \c linear_inequality_scales must be specified
\li <tt>'auto'</tt> - automatic scaling
If a single string is
specified it will apply to all constraints. 

Scaling for linear constraints is
applied \e after any continuous variable scaling. For example, for
variable scaling on continuous design variables x: \f[ \tilde{x}^j =
\frac{x^j - x^j_O}{x^j_M} \f] we have the following system for linear
inequality constraints \f[ a_L \leq A_i x \leq a_U \f] \f[ a_L \leq
A_i \left( \mathrm{diag}(x_M) \tilde{x} + x_O \right) \leq a_U \f] \f[
a_L - A_i x_O \leq A_i \mathrm{diag}(x_M) \tilde{x} \leq a_U - A_i x_O
\f] \f[ \tilde{a}_L \leq \tilde{A}_i \tilde{x} \leq \tilde{a}_U \f]
and user-specified or automatically computed scaling multipliers are
appplied to this final transformed system, which accounts for
continuous design variable scaling. When automatic scaling is in use
for linear constraints they are linearly scaled by a computed
characteristic value, but not affinely to [0,1].

Rapid Optimization Library (ROL) is a large-scale
optimization package within Trilinos.

Description::

ROL is used for the solution of optimal design, optimal control and
inverse problems in large-scale engineering applications.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

ROL is a general gradient-based library designed to scale well to very
large problem sizes.  For large problem sizes (i.e. number of variables),
ROLâ€™s trust region method and conjugate gradient methods exhibit good
scalability for unconstrained problems. ROL handles equality constraints
natively but converts inequality constraints into equality constraints
with bounded slack variables.  This has might degrade convergence
for problems involving large number of inequality constraints.  ROL has
traditionally been applied to problems with analytic gradients (and
Hessians)but can can be used with Dakota-provided finite-differencing
approximations to the gradient of both objective and constraints.  However,
a user employing these is advised to use alternative optimizers such as DOT
until performance of ROL improves in future releases.

X-convergence tolerance
Description::
\c x_conv_tol maps to the internal NL2SOL control \c xctol. 
It is the X-convergence tolerance (scaled relative
accuracy of the solution variables).

The internal default is a function of machine epsilon 
(as limited by \c function_precision). The default is selected with a value of -1.

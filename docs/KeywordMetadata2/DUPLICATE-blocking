Blurb::
Evaluate all points in a pattern
Description::

In the \c blocking case, all points in the pattern are evaluated (in parallel), 
and if the best of these trial points is an improving point, then it becomes 
the next iterate. These runs are reproducible, assuming use of the same seed 
in the stochastic case.

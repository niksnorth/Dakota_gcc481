Stopping criterion based on volume of search space
Description::
\c volume_boxsize_limit is a setting that terminates the optimization
when the volume of a hyperrectangle S with f(c(S)) = fmin is less than
volume_boxsize_limit percent of the original hyperrectangle.
Basically, volume_boxsize_limit stops the optimization when the volume
of the particular rectangle which has fmin is less than a certain
percentage of the whole volume.

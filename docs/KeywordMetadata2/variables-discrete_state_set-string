String-valued discrete state set variables

Description::
Discrete state variables whose values come from a specified set of
admissible strings.  The details of how to specify this discrete
variable are located on the \ref topic-discrete_variables page. See
the \ref topic-state_variables page for details on the behavior of
state variables.  Each string element value must be quoted and may
contain alphanumeric, dash, underscore, and colon. White space, quote
characters, and backslash/metacharacters are not permitted.

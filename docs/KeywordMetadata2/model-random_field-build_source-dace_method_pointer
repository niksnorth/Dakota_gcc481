Pointer to a DACE method for purposes of generating an ensemble of field responses to be used 
in estimating a random field model.
THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL CAPABILITY. 

Description::
As part of the capability to generate a random field representation, the user 
needs to specify the data used to generate the random field representation. 
One way to do this is to run a set of simulations and generating field responses. 
Dakota will then take the full set of field responses (e.g. multiple samples, where 
each sample has a field response) and construct a random field model representing the 
uncertainty in the ensemble.  The \c dace_method_pointer is a pointer to a 
Design and Analysis of Computer Experiments (DACE) method, typically 
which is a sampling method.  In this case, the sampling method 
should be on a simulation which can generate field responses (e.g. \c field_responses, \c field_objectives, or 
\c field_calibration terms.)

THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL CAPABILITY UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT. 

<b> Default Behavior </b>
Currently, the \c build_source that is fully working is the 
\c dace_method_pointer.  The others are not fully operational.

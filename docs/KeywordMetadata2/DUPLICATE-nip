Uses a nonlinear interior point method for underlying optimization

Description::
Many uncertainty quantification methods solve a constrained optimization problem under the hood.  The \c nip keyword directs Dakota to use a nonlinear interior point to solve that problem.  A nonlinear interior point method traverses the interior of the feasible region to arrive at the solution to the optimization problem.

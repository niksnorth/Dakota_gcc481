Tolerance for whether a subregion is worth dividing
Description::
The \c global_balance_parameter controls how much global search is
performed by only allowing a subregion to be subdivided if the size of
the subregion divided by the size of the largest subregion is at least
\c global_balance_parameter.  Intuitively, this forces large
subregions to be subdivided before the smallest subregions are
refined.

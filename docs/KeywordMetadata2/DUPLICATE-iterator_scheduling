Specify the scheduling of concurrent iterators when Dakota is run in parallel
Description::
An important feature for component-based iterators is that execution
of sub-iterator runs may be performed concurrently. The optional 
\c iterator_scheduling specification supports user override
of the automatic parallel configuration for the number of iterator 
servers. That is, if the automatic configuration is
undesirable for some reason, the user can enforce a desired number of
partitions at the iterator parallelism level. Currently, \c hybrid, 
\c multi_start, and \c pareto_set component-based iterators support 
concurrency in their sub-iterators. Refer to ParallelLibrary 
and the Parallel Computing chapter of the Users Manual 
\cite UsersMan for additional information.

Uses a sequential quadratic programming method for underlying optimization

Description::
Many uncertainty quantification methods solve a constrained optimization problem under the hood.  The \c sqp keyword directs Dakota to use a sequential quadratic programming method to solve that problem.  A sequential quadratic programming solves a sequence of linearly constrained quadratic optimization problems to arrive at the solution to the optimization problem.

Select a mutation type
Description::
The \c mutation_type controls what approach is employed in randomly modifying 
continuous design variables within the EA population. Each of the mutation 
methods generates coordinate-wise changes to individuals, usually by adding a 
random variable to a given coordinate value (an \c offset_* mutation), but also by 
replacing a given coordinate value with a random variable (a \c replace_* 
mutation).

Discrete design variables are always mutated using the \c offset_uniform method.

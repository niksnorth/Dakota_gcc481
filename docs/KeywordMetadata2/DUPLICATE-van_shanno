The merit function by Vanderbei and Shanno
Description::
The "van_shanno" merit function can be classified as a penalty
function for the logarithmic barrier formulation of the nonlinear
programming problem. The cost per linesearch iteration is one function
evaluation. For more information see \cite VanShanno1999.

If the function evaluation is expensive or noisy, set the \c
merit_function to "argaez_tapia" or "van_shanno".

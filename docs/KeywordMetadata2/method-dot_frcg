DOT conjugate gradient optimization method

Description::
DOT library \cite Van95 implementation of Fletcher-Reeves conjugate
gradient method for unconstrained optimizaiton.

See \ref topic-package_dot for information common to all \c DOT methods.

<em>DOT requires a separate software license and therefore may not
be available in all versions of Dakota.  CONMIN or OPT++ methods may
be suitable alternatives.</em>

<em>Caution regarding \c dot_frcg.</em> In DOT
Version 4.20, we have noticed inconsistent behavior of this algorithm
across different versions of Linux. Our best assessment is that it is
due to different treatments of uninitialized variables. As we do not
know the intention of the code authors and maintaining DOT source code
is outside of the %Dakota project scope, we have not made nor are we
recommending any code changes to address this. However, all users who
use \c dot_frcg in DOT Version 4.20 should be aware that
results may not be reliable.

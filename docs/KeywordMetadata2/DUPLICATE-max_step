Max change in design point
Description::
The \c max_step control specifies the maximum step that can be taken
when computing a change in the current design point (e.g., limiting
the Newton step computed from current gradient and Hessian
information). It is equivalent to a move limit or a maximum trust
region size. The \c gradient_tolerance control defines the threshold
value on the L2 norm of the objective function gradient that indicates
convergence to an unconstrained minimum (no active constraints). The
\c gradient_tolerance control is defined for all gradient-based
optimizers.

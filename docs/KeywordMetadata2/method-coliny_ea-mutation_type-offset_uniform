Set mutation offset to use a uniform distribution
Description::
The \c offset_uniform type is an "offset" mutation that adds a 0-mean random 
variable with a uniform distribution to the existing coordinate value. 
The offset is limited in magnitude by \c mutation_scale 

For discrete design variables, \c offset_uniform is always used, and
\c mutation_range controls the magnitude of the mutation.

Select a replacement type for SCOLIB evolutionary algorithm (\c coliny_ea)
Description::
The replacement_type controls how current populations and newly
generated individuals are combined to create a new population. Each of
the replacement_type selections accepts an associated integer value, which is
specified by the \c replacement_size:

The random setting creates a new population using (a) \c replacement_size
randomly selected individuals from the current population, and (b)
\c population_size - \c replacement_size individuals randomly selected from
among the newly generated individuals (the number of which is
optionally specified using \c new_solutions_generated) that are created
for each generation (using the selection, crossover, and mutation
procedures).

The chc setting creates a new population using (a) the
\c replacement_size best individuals from the combination of the current
population and the newly generated individuals, and (b)
\c population_size - \c replacement_size individuals randomly selected from
among the remaining individuals in this combined pool. The chc setting
is the preferred selection for many engineering problems.

The elitist (default) setting creates a new population using (a) the
\c replacement_size best individuals from the current population, (b) and
\c population_size - \c replacement_size individuals randomly selected from
the newly generated individuals. It is possible in this case to lose a
good solution from the newly generated individuals if it is not
randomly selected for replacement; however, the default
\c new_solutions_generated value is set such that the entire set of newly
generated individuals will be selected for replacement.

Note that \c new_solutions_generated is not recognized by Dakota as a
valid keyword unless \c replacement_type has been specified.

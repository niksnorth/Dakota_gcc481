Blurb::
Selects annotated tabular file format for experiment data

Description::

An annotated tabular file is a whitespace-separated text file with one
leading header row of comments/column labels.  For experiment data
files, each subsequent row contains an experiment ID, followed by data
for configuration variables, observations, and/or observation errors,
depending on context.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

By default, Dakota imports tabular experiment data files in annotated
format.  The \c annotated keyword can be used to explicitly specify
this.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

\li Prior to October 2011, calibration and surrogate data files were
in free-form format. They now default to \c annotated format, though \c
freeform remains an option.

\li When importing tabular data, a warning will be generated if a
specific number of data are expected, but extra is found and an error
generated when there is insufficient data.

Examples::

Import an annotated experimental data file containing a header row, leading
exp_id column, and experiment data in a calibration study

\verbatim
responses
  ...
  scalar_data_file 'shock_experiment.dat'
    annotated
\endverbatim

Example data file with two measured quantities, three experiments:
\verbatim
%exp_id		velocity	stress
1		18.23		83.21
2		34.14		93.24
3		22.41		88.92
\endverbatim

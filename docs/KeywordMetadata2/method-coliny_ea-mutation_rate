Set probability of a mutation
Description::
The \c mutation_rate controls the probability of mutation being performed on an individual, both for new individuals generated by crossover (if crossover occurs) and for individuals from the existing population. It is the fraction of trial points that are mutated in a given iteration and therefore must be specified to be between 0 and 1.

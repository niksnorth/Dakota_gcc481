Blurb:: Restrict the cross validation process to estimating only the
best noise tolerance.

Description:: By default, cross validation estimates both the best
noise tolerance and the best candidate basis order.  For reasons of
reducing computational cost by reducing the number of candidate
solves, the user may wish to restrict this process to estimating only
the best noise tolerance.

Generally speaking, computing the best noise tolerance through cross
validation mitigates issues with over-fitting the data.  Computing the
best candidate basis order can also mitigate overfitting, while also
controlling levels of mutual coherence resulting from high-order
Vandermonde-like matrix systems.

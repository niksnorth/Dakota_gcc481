Blurb::
Refine until the estimated covergence order converges
Description::
The \c converge_order option is initialized using the \c
estimate_order aproach, and additional refinements are performed
along the refinement path until the convergence order estimates
converge (two-norm of the change in response orders is less than
the convergence tolerance).

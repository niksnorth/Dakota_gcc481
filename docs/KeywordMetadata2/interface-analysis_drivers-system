Blurb::
(Not recommended) Launch analysis drivers with a system call

Description::
The system call interface is included in %Dakota for portability and
backward compatibility. Users are strongly encouraged to use the \c
fork interface if possible, reverting to system only when
necessary. To enable the system call interface, replace the \c fork
keyword with \c system. All other keywords have identical meanings to
those for the fork interface

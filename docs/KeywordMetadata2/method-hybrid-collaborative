Blurb::
Multiple methods run concurrently and share information
Description::

In the collaborative approach, multiple methods work together and
share solutions while executing concurrently. A list of method strings
specifies the pool of iterators to be used. Any number of iterators
may be specified. The method collaboration logic follows that of
either the Agent-Based Optimization or HOPSPACK codes and is currently
under development and not available at this time.

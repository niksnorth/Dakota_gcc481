First-order integration scheme
Description::   
First-order integration in local reliability methods uses the minimum Euclidean distance 
from the origin to the most probable point (MPP) in transformed space to compute the probability of failure.  
This distance, commonly called the reliability index Beta, is used to calculate the probability of failure 
by calculating the standard normal cumulative distribution function at -Beta.

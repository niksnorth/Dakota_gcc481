Discrete, epistemic uncertain variable - strings within a set

Description::
Discrete set variables may be used to specify categorical choices which are
epistemic. For example, if we have three possible forms for a physics
model (model 1, 2, or 3) and there is epistemic uncertainty about
which one is correct, a discrete uncertain set 
may be used to represent this type of uncertainty.

This variable is defined by a set of strings, in which the discrete value may
take any value within the string set (for example, the set may be
defined as 'coarse', 'medium', and 'fine')

Other epistemic types include:
\li \ref variables-continuous_interval_uncertain
\li \ref variables-discrete_interval_uncertain
\li discrete_uncertain_set \ref variables-discrete_uncertain_set-integer
\li discrete_uncertain_set \ref variables-discrete_uncertain_set-real

\li discrete_uncertain_set \ref variables-discrete_uncertain_set-string

In addition to continuous and discrete aleatory probability
distributions, %Dakota provides support for continuous and discrete
epistemic uncertainties through the keywords:

Interval-based and set variables do not represent probability distributions.

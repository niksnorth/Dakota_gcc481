Blurb::
Group to specify nonlinear equality constraints

Description::
Specifies the number of nonlinear equality constraint functions
returned by the interface.

The \c targets specification provides the targets for nonlinear
equalities of the form
\f[h(x) = h_t\f]
and the defaults for the equality targets enforce a value of \c 0.
for each constraint
\f[h(x) = 0.0\f]

The \c scale_types and \c scales keywords are related to scaling of
\f$ h \left( x \right) \f$. See the scaling information under specific
methods, e.g., method-*-scaling for details on how to use this
keyword.

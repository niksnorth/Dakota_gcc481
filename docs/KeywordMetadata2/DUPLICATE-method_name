Specify sub-method by name
Description::
The \c method_name keyword is used to specify a sub-method by %Dakota method
name (e.g. 'npsol_sqp') rather than block pointer. The method will be executed 
using its default settings. The optional \c model_pointer specification can be
used to associate a model block with the method.

Selects custom-annotated tabular file format

Description::

A custom-annotated tabular file is a whitespace-separated text file
typically containing row data for variables, or variables followed by
responses, though the format is used for other tabular exports/imports
as well.  Custom-annotated allows user options for whether \c header
row, \c eval_id column, and \c interface_id column appear in the
tabular file, thus bridging \c freeform and (fully) \c annotated.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

The \c annotated format is the default for tabular export/import. To
control which header row and columns are in the input/output, specify
\c custom_annotated, followed by options, in the relevant
export/import context.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

\li Prior to October 2011, calibration and surrogate data files were
in free-form format. They now default to \c annotated format, though \c
freeform remains an option.

\li When importing tabular data, a warning will be generated if a
specific number of data are expected, but extra is found and an error
generated when there is insufficient data.

\li Some TPLs like SCOLIB and JEGA manage their own file I/O and only
support the \c freeform option.

Examples::

Export a custom-annotated tabular file in Dakota 6.0 format, which
contained only header and eval_id (no interface_id), and data for
variables and responses.  Input file fragment:
\verbatim
environment
  tabular_data
    tabular_data_file = 'dakota_summary.dat'
    custom_annotated header eval_id
\endverbatim
Resulting tabular file:
\verbatim
%eval_id             x1             x2         obj_fn nln_ineq_con_1 nln_ineq_con_2 
1                   0.9            1.1         0.0002           0.26           0.76 
2               0.90009            1.1 0.0001996404857   0.2601620081       0.759955

Specify weights for each objective function

Description::

For multi-objective optimization problems (where the number of
objective functions is greater than 1), then a \c weights
specification provides a simple weighted-sum approach to combining
multiple objectives into a single objective: \f[f = \sum_{i=1}^{n}
w_{i}f_{i}\f]

<b>Default Behavior</b>
If weights are not specified, then each response is given equal weighting: 
\f[f = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{f_i}{n}\f] where, in both of these cases, a
"minimization" sense will retain a positive weighting for a minimizer
and a "maximization" sense will apply a negative weighting.

If scaling is specified, it is applied before multi-objective weighted
sums are formed.

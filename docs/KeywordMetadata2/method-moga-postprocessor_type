Post process the final solution from \c moga
Description::
The purpose of this operation is to perform any needed data
manipulations on the final solution deemed necessary. Currently the \c
orthogonal_distance is the only one. It reduces the final solution set
size such that a minimum distance in each direction exists between any
two designs.

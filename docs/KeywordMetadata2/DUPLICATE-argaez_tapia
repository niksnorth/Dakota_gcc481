The merit function by Tapia and Argaez 
Description::
The "argaez_tapia" merit function can be classified as a modified
augmented Lagrangian function. The augmented Lagrangian is modified by
adding to its penalty term a potential reduction function to handle
the perturbed complementarity condition. The cost per linesearch
iteration is one function evaluation. For more information, see
\cite Tapia1.

If the function evaluation is expensive or noisy, set the \c
merit_function to "argaez_tapia" or "van_shanno".

Active (variable) subspace model

Description::
A model that transforms the original model (given by \ref
model-active_subspace-actual_model_pointer) to one with a reduced set of variables.  This
reduced model is identified by iteratively sampling the gradient of
the original model and performing a singular value decomposition of
the gradient matrix.

<b> Expected Output </b>

A subspace model will perform an initial sampling design to
identify an active subspace using one of the truncation methods.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

If the desired subspace size is not identified, consider using the explicit
\ref model-active_subspace-dimension truncation option or one of the other truncation methods.

Topics::

Examples::
Perform an initial 100 gradient samples and use the \ref model-active_subspace-truncation_method-bing_li
truncation method to identify an active subspace. The truncation method uses 150 bootstrap samples
to compute the Bing Li truncation metric.

\verbatim
model                             
  subspace
    id_model = 'SUBSPACE'
    actual_model_pointer = 'FULLSPACE'
    initial_samples  100
    truncation_method bing_li
    bootstrap_samples 150
\endverbatim

Theory::
The idea behind active subspaces is to find directions in the input variable
space in which the quantity of interest is nearly constant. After rotation of
the input variables, this method can allow significant dimension reduction. Below is a brief summary of the process.

1. Compute the gradient of the quantity of interest, \f$q = f(\mathbf{x})\f$,
    at several locations sampled from the full input space,
    \f[\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} f_i = \nabla f(\mathbf{x}_i).\f]

2. Compute the eigendecomposition of the matrix \f$\hat{\mathbf{C}}\f$,
    \f[\hat{\mathbf{C}} = \frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=1}^{M}\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} f_i\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} f_i^T = \hat{\mathbf{W}}\hat{\mathbf{\Lambda}}\hat{\mathbf{W}}^T,\f]
    where \f$\hat{\mathbf{W}}\f$ has eigenvectors as columns, 
    \f$\hat{\mathbf{\Lambda}} = \text{diag}(\hat{\lambda}_1,\:\ldots\:,\hat{\lambda}_N)\f$
    contains eigenvalues, and \f$N\f$ is the total number of parameters.

3. Using a \ref model-active_subspace-truncation_method or specifying a
    \ref model-active_subspace-dimension to estimate the active subspace size, 
    split the eigenvectors into active and inactive directions,
    \f[\hat{\mathbf{W}} = \left[\hat{\mathbf{W}}_1\quad\hat{\mathbf{W}}_2\right].\f]
    These eigenvectors are used to rotate the input variables.

4. Next the input variables, \f$\mathbf{x}\f$, are expanded in terms of active and
    inactive variables,
    \f[\mathbf{x} = \hat{\mathbf{W}}_1\mathbf{y} + \hat{\mathbf{W}}_2\mathbf{z}.\f]

5. A surrogate is then built as a function of the active variables,
    \f[g(\mathbf{y}) \approx f(\mathbf{x})\f]

Uses purely random Monte Carlo sampling to sample variables

Description::
The \c random keyword invokes Monte Carlo sampling as the means of
drawing samples of uncertain variables according to their probability
distributions.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

In most contexts, Monte Carlo sampling is not the default sampling mode
(exception: multilevel_sampling).  To change this behavior, the \c
random keyword must be specified in conjuction with the \c sample_type
keyword.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

Monte Carlo sampling is more computationally expensive than Latin
Hypercube Sampling as it requires a larger number of samples to
accurately estimate statistics.

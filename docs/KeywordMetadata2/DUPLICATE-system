Blurb:: Compute system reliability (series or parallel)

Description::
With the system probability/reliability option, statistics for
specified \c response_levels are calculated and reported assuming the
response functions combine either in series or parallel to produce a
total system response.

For a series system, the system fails when any one component
(response) fails.  The probability of failure is the complement of the
product of the individual response success probabilities.

For a parallel system, the system fails only when all components
(responses) fail.  The probability of failure is the product of the
individual response failure probabilities.

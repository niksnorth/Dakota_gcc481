Number of data points used during initial Bayesian calibration

Description::
The experimental design algorithm starts with a preliminary Bayesian 
calibration. The keyword \c initial_samples specifies the number of data points 
used during this initial calibration. These data points may come from external 
data sources through \c calibration_data_file, from an LHS sample of the 
design space, or both.

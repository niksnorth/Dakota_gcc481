Blurb::
Specify the number of basis functions to be used in the random field representation.
THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL CAPABILITY. 

Description::
This control allows the user to specify the number of basis functions to be 
used in the random field representation (e.g. either a Karhunen-Loeve or Principal Components expansion). 
Typically, a small number of basis functions (3-5) will be sufficient to represent a significant 
amount of the variance in the response field.  However, this depends on the particulars of the problem. 
THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL CAPABILITY UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT. 

<b> Default Behavior </b>
If the user specifies neither \c trunction_tolerance nor \c expansion_bases, then 
the number of expansion bases that captures 95% of the variance will be used.

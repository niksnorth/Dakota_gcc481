Reuse the same sequence and samples for multiple sampling sets
Description::
The \c fixed_sequence control is similar to \c fixed_seed for other sampling 
methods. If \c fixed_sequence is specified, the user will get the same 
sequence (meaning the same set of samples) for subsequent calls of 
the QMC sampling method (for example, this might be used in a surrogate 
based optimization method or a parameter study where one wants to 
fix the uncertain variables).

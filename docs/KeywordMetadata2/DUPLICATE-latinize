Adjust samples to improve the discrepancy of the marginal distributions
Description::
The \c latinize control takes the samples and "latinizes" them, meaning 
that each original sample is moved so that it falls into one strata or 
bin in each dimension as in Latin Hypercube sampling. The default setting 
is NOT to latinize. However, one may 
be interested in doing this in situations where one wants better discrepancy
of the 1-dimensional projections (the marginal distributions).

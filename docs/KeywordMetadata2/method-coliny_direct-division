Determine how rectangles are subdivided
Description::
The \c division specification determines how DIRECT subdivides each
subregion of the search space.

If \c division is set to \c major_dimension, then the dimension
representing the longest edge of the subregion is subdivided (this is
the default). If \c division is set to \c all_dimensions, then all
dimensions are simultaneously subdivided.

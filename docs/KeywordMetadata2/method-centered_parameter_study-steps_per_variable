Number of steps to take in each dimension of a centered parameter study

Description::
The \c steps_per_variable keyword allows the user to define the number
of steps in each dimesion of a centered parameter study.  Because they
are taken independently, the number of steps can be specified for
each.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

The user is required to define the number of steps per variable for a
centered parameter study.  There are no default values.

Steps are taken in the plus and minus directions, and are defined in
either actual values (continuous and discrete range) or index offsets
(discrete set).

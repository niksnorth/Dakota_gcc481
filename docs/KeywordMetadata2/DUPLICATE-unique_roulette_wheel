Replace population
Description::
Replace the population with members selected to continue in the next
generation.  The pool of potential members is the current population
and the current set of offspring.  The \c replacement_type of \c
roulette_wheel or \c unique_roulette_wheel may be used either with
MOGA or SOGA problems however they are not recommended for use with
MOGA.  Given that the only two fitness assessors for MOGA are the \c
layer_rank and \c domination_count, the recommended selector is the \c
below_limit selector.  The \c below_limit replacement will only keep
designs that are dominated by fewer than a limiting number of other
designs.  The \c replacement_type of \c favor_feasible is specific to
a SOGA.  This replacement operator will always prefer a more feasible
design to a less feasible one.  Beyond that, it favors solutions based
on an assigned fitness value which must have been installed by the
weighted sum only fitness assessor (see the discussion below).
